But it doesn't cover all the bases on its own – there are some things that Kubernetes cannot solve or that are outside its scope.</p><p>This is one of the reasons why open source projects are so great. They help amazing tools become even more amazing when we combine them with other awesome open-source tools. And often these tools were developed for the sole purpose of filling the gaps. One of these tools is Helm.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-helm\">What is Helm?</h2><p><a href=\"https://helm.sh\">Helm</a> is widely known as \"the package manager for <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Kubernetes</a>\". Although it presents itself like this, its scope goes way beyond that of a simple package manager. However, let's start at the beginning.</p><p>Helm is an open-source project which was originally created by <a href=\"https://deislabs.io/\">DeisLabs</a> and donated to <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-cncf/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">CNCF</a>, which now maintains it. The original goal of Helm was to provide users with a better way to manage all the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Kubernetes</a> YAML files we create on <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Kubernetes</a> projects.</p><p>The path <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Helm</a> took to solve this issue was to create Helm <strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Charts</a></strong>. Each chart is a bundle with one or more <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Kubernetes</a> manifests – a chart can have child charts and dependent charts as well. </p><p>This means that Helm installs the whole dependency tree of a project if you run the install command for the top-level chart. You just a single command to install your entire application, instead of listing the files to install via <code>kubectl</code>.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Charts</a> allow you to version your manifest files too, just like we do with Node.js or any other package. This lets you install specific chart versions, which means keeping specific configurations for your infrastructure in the form of code. </p><p>Helm also keeps a release history of all deployed charts, so you can go back to a previous release if something went wrong.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Helm</a> supports <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">Kubernetes</a> natively, which means you don't have to write any complex syntax files or anything to start using Helm. Just drop your template files into a new chart and you're good to go.</p><p>But why should we use it? Managing application manifests can be easily done with a few combinations of commands.</p><h2 id=\"why-should-you-use-helm\">Why Should You Use Helm?</h2><p>Helm really shines where Kubernetes didn't go. For instance, templating. The scope of the Kubernetes project is to deal with your containers for you, not your template files. </p><p>This makes it overly difficult to create truly generic files to be used across a large team or a large organization with many different parameters that need to be set for each file. </p><p>And also, how do you version sensitive information using Git when template files are plain text?</p><p>The answer: Go templates. Helm allows you to add variables and use functions inside your template files. This makes it perfect for scalable applications that'll eventually need to have their parameters changed. Let's look at an example.</p><p>I have an open-source project called <a href=\"https://github.com/khaosdoctor/zaqar/\">Zaqar</a>, a simple email microservice for Node.js which communicates with SendGrid. The project is basically composed of a service, a deployment and an autoscaler. </p><p>Let's take the deployment file as the example. I'd have something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: zaqar\n  namespace: default\n  labels:\n    app: zaqar\n    version: v1.0.0\n    env: production\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: zaqar\n      env: production\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: zaqar\n        version: v1.0.0\n        env: production\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: zaqar\n          image: \"khaosdoctor/zaqar:v1.0.0\"\n          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n          env:\n            - name: SENDGRID_APIKEY\n              value: \"MY_SECRET_KEY\"\n            - name: DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS\n              value: \"my@email.com\"\n            - name: DEFAULT_FROM_NAME\n              value: \"Lucas Santos\"\n          ports:\n            - name: http\n              containerPort: 3000\n              protocol: TCP\n          resources:\n            requests:\n              cpu: 100m\n              memory: 128Mi\n            limits:\n              cpu: 250m\n              memory: 256Mi</code></pre><p>If I wanted to use this template on a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/aks-deployment-pipeline-github-actions/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">CI pipeline</a>, or publish it on my <a href=\"https://github.com/khaosdoctor\">GitHub</a>, I'd need to replace the variable parts with placeholders. So we can replace these texts with the required information. </p><p>In this case, both the version tag, the <code>env</code> label, and the environment variables would be replaced by placeholders, like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: zaqar\n  namespace: default\n  labels:\n    app: zaqar\n    version: #!VERSION!#\n    env: #!ENV!#\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: zaqar\n      env: #!ENV!#\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: zaqar\n        version: #!VERSION!#\n        env: #!ENV!#\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: zaqar\n          image: \"khaosdoctor/zaqar:#!VERSION!#\"\n          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n          env:\n            - name: SENDGRID_APIKEY\n              value: \"#!SENDGRID_KEY!#\"\n            - name: DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS\n              value: \"#!FROM_ADDR!#\"\n            - name: DEFAULT_FROM_NAME\n              value: \"#!FROM_NAME!#\"\n          ports:\n            - name: http\n              containerPort: 3000\n              protocol: TCP\n          resources:\n            requests:\n              cpu: 100m\n              memory: 128Mi\n            limits:\n              cpu: 250m\n              memory: 256Mi</code></pre><p>We can now run our <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/aks-deployment-pipeline-github-actions/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">CI pipeline</a>. But before we do that, we need to replace our placeholders with the actual values. </p><p>For this we can use <code>sed</code> and its \"super easy\" syntax <code>sed 's/#!PLACEHOLDER!#/replacement/g'</code>, and pipe this down until we finish all the placeholders. The final command would be something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cat deploy.yaml | \\\n    sed 's/#!ENV!#/production/g' | \\\n    sed 's/#!VERSION!#/v1.0.0/g' | \\\n    sed 's/#!SENDGRID_KEY!#/MyKey/g' | \\\n    sed 's/#!FROM_ADDR!#/my@email.com/g' | \\\n    sed 's/#!FROM_NAME!#/Lucas Santos/g'</code></pre><p>By default, sed outputs everything to the <code>stdout</code>, so we can add another pipe to <code>kubectl -f</code>, like <code>&lt;all the command from before&gt; | kubectl -f -</code>. Then we'll have our deployment in place. The only problem is that we need to do the same for <strong>all</strong> the other files. </p><p>Now imagine a larger project, with lots of other variables and placeholders. You'd probably write a script to do it for you, wouldn't you? That script is Helm.</p><p>When you create a Chart (more on this later on), we have a specific directory tree that we must follow so Helm understands what we want to do. Inside the <code>templates</code> directory, we can add our manifest files, <strong>with native go templating,</strong> like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ .Values.name }}\n  namespace: {{ default .Release.Namespace .Values.namespace }}\n  labels:\n    app: {{ .Values.name }}\n    version: {{ .Values.image.tag }}\n    env: {{ .Values.env }}\nspec:\n  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: {{ .Values.name }}\n      env: {{ .Values.env }}\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: {{ .Values.name }}\n        version: {{ .Values.image.tag }}\n        env: {{ .Values.env }}\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}\n          image: \"khaosdoctor/zaqar:{{ .Values.image.tag }}\"\n          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}\n          env:\n            - name: SENDGRID_APIKEY\n              value: {{ required \"You must set a valid Sendgrid API key\" .Values.environment.SENDGRID_APIKEY | quote }}\n            - name: DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS\n              value: {{ required \"You must set a default from address\" .Values.environment.DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS | quote }}\n            - name: DEFAULT_FROM_NAME\n              value: {{ required \"You must set a default from name\" .Values.environment.DEFAULT_FROM_NAME | quote }}\n          ports:\n            - name: http\n              containerPort: 3000\n              protocol: TCP\n          resources:\n            {{- toYaml .Values.resources | nindent 12 }}</code></pre><p>All those values can be obtained from a <code>Values.yaml</code> file (for default values), or you can set them in the CLI using the <code>--set &lt;path&gt; value</code> flag. </p><p>If we want to install our chart we can issue the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">helm upgrade --install --create-namespace myChart ./path/to/my/chart \\\n  --set image.tag=v1.0.0 \\\n  --set env=production \\\n  --set environment.SENDGRID_APIKEY=myKey \\\n  --set environment.DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS=\"my@email.com\" \\\n  --set environment.DEFAULT_FROM_NAME=\"Lucas Santos\"</code></pre><p>Helm also allows us to use functions inside our deployments. So we can have <code>default</code> functions to fallback to default values if they're not filled, like the namespace. Or we can have <code>required</code> which displays a message and fails to install the chart if the value is not provided, which is the case of our environment variables.</p><p>There are a lot of other useful functions in their <a href=\"https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/\">docs</a> - check 'em out.</p><p>Now we are able to not only more efficiently manage our application's resources, but also to publish these resources in an open-source version system without any hassle or security issue.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-create-a-helm-chart\">How to Create a Helm Chart</h2><p>It's pretty easy to create a chart in Helm. First, you need to have <a href=\"https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/\">Helm installed</a>. Then, just type in <code>helm create &lt;chart name&gt;</code> and it will create a directory filled with files and other directories. Those files are required for Helm to create a chart. </p><p>Let's take a closer look at what this file tree looks like and what the files are within it:</p><ul><li><strong>chart.yaml:</strong> This is where you'll put the information related to your chart. That includes the chart version, name, and description so you can find it if you publish it on an open repository. Also in this file you'll be able to set external <a href=\"https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#chart-dependencies\">dependencies</a> using the <code>dependencies</code> key.</li><li><strong>values.yaml</strong>: Like we saw before, this is the file that contains defaults for variables.</li><li><strong>templates (dir):</strong> This is the place where you'll put all your manifest files. Everything in here will be passed on and created in Kubernetes.</li><li><strong>charts:</strong> If your chart depends on another chart you own, or if you don't want to rely on Helm's default library (the default registry where Helm pull charts from), you can bring this same structure inside this directory. Chart dependencies are installed from the bottom to the top, which means if chart A depends on chart B, and B depends on C, the installation order will be C -&gt;B -&gt;A.</li></ul><p>There are other fields, but these are the most common, and they're the required ones. You can take a quick look at <a href=\"https://github.com/khaosdoctor/zaqar/tree/master/helm\">Zaqar's repository</a> to check on how we can publish open source charts.</p><p>A quick note: When installing Helm, make sure you're installing version 3. Version 2 still works, but it needs a server-side component called Tiller, which ties your helm installation to a single cluster. Helm 3 removed this need with the addition of several CRDs, but it's not supported in all Kubernetes versions.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-host-a-helm-chart\">How to Host a Helm Chart</h2><p>Ok, you created your chart, now what? Do we have to download the entire repository to install those charts? No! Helm has a <a href=\"https://artifacthub.io/\">public library for the most used charts</a>, which kind of works like Docker Hub. </p><p>You can also create your own chart repository and <a href=\"https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/\">host it online</a>. Helm drinks from the same fountain as HomeBrew, or Linux. You can tap these repositories to download charts contained in them. </p><p>Since a chart repository is basically an <code>index.yaml</code> file served from a static web server, you can pretty much create a chart repository out of anywhere.</p><p>Take <a href=\"https://github.com/khaosdoctor/zaqar/tree/master/helm\">Zaqar</a>, for example – it's hosted on GitHub Pages and is accessible through <a href=\"https://lsantos.me/zaqar/helm/index.yaml\">my domain</a>. When Helm looks for an <code>index.yaml</code> file it's actually looking for the list of available versions of that chart, their SHA256 digests, and the location of the packaged <code>.tgz</code> file to download the chart itself. This is pretty much what NPM does under the hood (overly simplified).</p><p>This means you don't need to have your repository cloned forever, and your charts can be private as well. You only need to create a chart repository. </p><p>You can even use <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-helm-repos?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">hosted services like Azure CR</a> to do the job, or you can have a full solution called <a href=\"https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum\">Chart Museum</a>, which allows you to store your charts and provides you with a neat UI.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Helm is here to stay. It has helped and will help a lot of Kubernetes developers out there for a long time. </p><p>If you want to know how to use Helm, you can refer to their <a href=\"https://helm.sh\">docs</a>, or you can take this <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/aks-app-package-management-using-helm/?WT.mc_id=containers-19838-ludossan\">free learn module</a> on how to deploy your applications on Kubernetes the easy way with Helm.</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

And you're likely aware that it has become important tech for any application developer to know. </p><p>If you have no idea of what I'm talking about, no worries – that's what this article is for.</p><p>We'll go on a journey to discover what is this Docker everyone is talking about and what you can do with it. By the end, we'll also create, publish, and run our first Docker image.</p><p>But first, let's lay the foundation for our story. I'll be using this <a href=\"https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016\">amazing article</a> by Rani Osnat that explains the whole history of containers in more depth. And I'll summarize it here so we can focus on the important parts.</p><h2 id=\"a-little-bit-of-container-history\">A Little Bit of Container History</h2><p>Docker is a container runtime. A lot of people think that Docker was the first of its kind, but this is not true – Linux containers have existed since the 1970s. </p><p>Docker is important to both the development community and container community because it made using containers so easy that everyone started doing it.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-containers\">What are containers?</h3><p>Containers, or Linux Containers, are a technology that allows us to isolate certain kernel processes and trick them into thinking they're the only ones running in a completely new computer.</p><p>Different from Virtual Machines, a container can share the kernel of the operating system while only having their different binaries/libraries loaded with them. </p><p>In other words, you don't need to have whole different OS (called <strong>guest OS</strong>) installed inside your host OS. You can have several containers running within a single OS without having several different guest OS's installed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/image-166.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-166\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-166.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/image-166.png 640w\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Difference between Virtual Machines and Docker Containers (Source: Docker)</figcaption></figure><p>This makes containers much smaller, faster, and more efficient. While a VM can take about a minute to spin up and can weigh several Gigabytes, a container weighs, on average, 400 to 600mb (the biggest ones). </p><p>They also take only seconds to spin up. This is mostly because they don't have to spin a whole operating system before running the process.</p><p>And this all began with six characters.</p><h3 id=\"the-beginning-of-containers\">The beginning of containers</h3><p>The history of containers begins in 1979 with Unix v7. At that time, I wasn't even born, and my father was 15 years old. Did containers already exist in 1979? No! </p><p>In 1979, the Unix version 7 introduced a system call called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot\">chroot</a>, which was the very beginning of what we know today as <strong>process</strong> <strong>virtualization</strong>.</p><p>The <code>chroot</code> call allowed the kernel to change the apparent root directory of a process and its children. </p><p>In short, the process thinks it's running alone in the machine, because its file system is segregated from all other processes. This same syscall was introduced in BSD in 1982. But it was only two decades later when we had the first widespread application of it.</p><p>In 2000, a hosting provider was searching for better ways to manage their customers' websites, since they were all installed in the same machine and competed for the same resources. </p><p>This solution was called <code>jails</code>, and it was one of the first real attempts to isolate stuff at the process level. Jails allowed any FreeBSD users to partition the system into several independent, smaller systems (which are called <code>jails</code>). Each jail can have its own IP config and system config.</p><p>Jails were the first solution to expand the uses of <code>chroot</code> to allow not only the segregation at the filesystem level, but also virtualizing users, network, sub-systems and so on.</p><p>In 2008, LXC (<strong>L</strong>inu<strong>X</strong> <strong>C</strong>ontainers) was launched. It was, at the time, the first and most complete implementation of a container management system. It used control groups, namespaces, and a lot of what was built until then. The greatest advancement was that it was used straight from a Unix kernel, it didn't require any patches.</p><h2 id=\"docker\">Docker</h2><p>Finally, in 2010, Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Pahl created Docker during the Y Combinator startup incubator group. In 2011 the platform was launched. </p><p>Originally, Hykes started the Docker project in France as part of an internal project within dotCloud, a PaaS company that was shut down in 2016.</p><p>Docker didn't add much to the container runtimes at the time – the greatest contribution from Docker to the container ecosystem was the <strong>awareness</strong>. Its easy-to-use CLI and concepts democratized the use of containers to common developers, and not only to deep hacking companies that needed containers for some reason.</p><p>After 2013, several companies started adopting Docker as default container runtime because it standardized the use of containers worldwide. In 2013, Red Hat announced a Docker collaboration, in 2014 it was time for <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-and-docker-collaborate-on-new-ways-to-deploy-containers-on-azure/?WT.mc_id=containers-11424-ludossan\">Microsoft</a>, AWS, Stratoscale, and IBM.</p><p>In 2016, the first version of Docker for a different OS than Linux was announced. Windocks released a port of Docker's OSS project designed to run on Windows. And, by the end of the same year, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-and-docker-collaborate-on-new-ways-to-deploy-containers-on-azure/?WT.mc_id=containers-11424-ludossan\">Microsoft</a> announced that Docker was now natively supported on <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-and-docker-collaborate-on-new-ways-to-deploy-containers-on-azure/?WT.mc_id=containers-11424-ludossan\">Windows</a> through <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/?WT.mc_id=containers-11424-ludossan\">Hyper-V</a>.</p><blockquote>In 2019, Microsoft announced the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-win10?WT.mc_id=containers-11424-ludossan\">WSL2</a>, which made possible for Docker to run on Windows without the need of a virtualized machine on <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/?WT.mc_id=containers-11424-ludossan\">Hyper-V</a>. Docker is now natively multiplatform while still leveraging Linux's container approach.</blockquote><p>Finally, in 2020, Docker became the worldwide choice for containers. This happened not necessarily because it's better than others, but because it unifies all the implementations under a single easy-to-use platform with a CLI and a Daemon. And it does all of this while using simple concepts that we'll explore in the next sections.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-docker-work\">How Does Docker Work?</h2><p>Docker packages an application and all its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This is why we call them containers. Because they have all the necessary dependencies contained in a single piece of software.</p><p>Docker is composed of the following elements:</p><ul><li> a Daemon, which is used to build, run, and manage the containers</li><li>a high-level API which allows the user to communicate with the Daemon, </li><li>and a CLI, the interface we use to make this all available.</li></ul><h3 id=\"docker-containers\">Docker Containers</h3><p>Containers are abstractions of the app layer. They package all the code, libraries, and dependencies together. This makes it possible for multiple containers to run in the same host, so you can use that host's resources more efficiently.</p><p>Each container runs as an isolated process in the user space and take up less space than regular VMs due to their layered architecture. </p><p>These layers are called <strong>intermediate images</strong>, and these images are created every time you run a new command in the <code>Dockerfile</code>, for instance, if you have a Dockerfile that's like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-dockerfile\">FROM node:stable\n\nCOPY . /usr/src/app\n\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\n\nRUN npm install grpc\n\nRUN npm install\n\nENTRYPOINT [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n</code></pre><p>At each command like <code>COPY</code> or <code>RUN</code> you'll be creating another layer on top of your container image. This allows Docker to split and separate each command into a separate part. So if you eventually use this <code>node:stable</code> image again, it won't need to pull all the layers of it, because you have already installed this image. </p><p>Also, all layers are hashed, which means Docker can cache those layers and optimize build times for layers that didn't change across builds. You won't need to rebuild and re-copy all the files if the COPY step hasn't changed, which greatly reduces the amount of time spent in build processes.</p><p>In the end of the build process, Docker creates a new empty layer on top of all layers called <strong>thin writable layer.</strong> This layer is the one you access when using <code>docker exec -it &lt;container&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>. This way you can perform interactive changes in the image and commit those using <code>docker commit</code>, just like you'd do with a Git tracked file.</p><p>This hash-diffed layer architecture is possible because of the AuFS file system. This is a layered FS that allows files and directories to be stacked as layers one upon another. </p><p>AuFS pose some problems when dealing with DnD (Docker in Docker), but this is a subject for other article! You can check out a deeper explanation in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@BeNitinAgarwal/docker-containers-filesystem-demystified-b6ed8112a04a\">this article</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-13\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-13.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png 620w\" width=\"620\" height=\"370\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Layers can be hash-diffed among versions. This way Docker can check if a layer has changed when building an image and decide whether to rebuild it, saving a lot of time. </p><p>So, if you already have the Ubuntu image downloaded on your computer, and you're building a new image which relies on one or more layers of that image, Docker won't build them again. It'll just reuse the same layers. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-14.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-14\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-14.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-14.png 651w\" width=\"651\" height=\"430\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>(source: Packt) Docker layers explained</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to dig deeper into layers, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jessgreb01/digging-into-docker-layers-c22f948ed612\">this article</a> gives a lot of detail on how to find, list, and manage them.</p><h3 id=\"why-docker-containers-are-great\">Why Docker containers are great</h3><p>You have probably heard the iconic phrase \"It works on my machine\". Well, why don't we give that machine to the customer? </p><p>That's exactly the problem Docker and containers solve in general. A Docker container is a packaged collection of all the app's libraries and dependencies already prebuilt and ready to be executed.</p><p>A lot of companies have migrated over from VMs to containers not only because they're much lighter and faster to spin up, but also because they're extremely easy to maintain. </p><p>A single container can be versioned using its <code>Dockerfile</code> (we'll get to images in the next section), so it makes quite easy for one developer (or even a small team of developers) to run and maintain a whole ecosystem of containers. On the other hand, you would need an infrastructure person just to be able to run and housekeep VMs.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-68.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-68\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-68.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-68.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-68.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1600\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>(source: Docker) Your Datacenter with VMs and containers</figcaption></figure><p>Does this mean that we don't needVMs anymore? No, on the contrary, VMs are still very much needed if you want to have a whole operating system for each customer or just need the whole environment as a sandbox. VMs are usually used as middle layers when you have a big server rack and several customers that'll be using it.</p><p>The ease of use and maintainability leads us to another important aspect of why containers are so great: it's way cheaper for a company to use containers than fully fledged VMs. </p><p>This is not because the infrastructure or hardware is cheaper, but because you need fewer people to housekeep containers, which means you can better organize your team to focus on the product instead of focusing on housekeeping.</p><p>Still related to savings, a single medium-sized VM can run about 3 to 8 containers. It depends on how many resources your containers use and how much of the underlying OS it needs to boot before running the whole application. </p><p>Some languages, like Go, allow you to build an image with only the compiled binary and nothing else. This means the Docker container will have much less to load and therefore will use fewer resources. This way you can spin up more containers per VM and use your hardware more efficiently.</p><p>Since containers are made to be ephemeral, this means all data inside them is lost when the container is deleted. This is great, because we can use containers for burstable tasks like CI. </p><p>The use of containers has brought a whole new level of DevOps advancements. Now you can simply spin up lots of containers, each one doing one small step of your deployment pipeline, and then just kill them without worrying if you've left something behind. </p><p>The stateless nature of containers makes them the perfect tool for fast workloads.</p><p>Now that we've seen how containers are awesome, let's understand how we can build one of them!</p><h2 id=\"what-are-docker-images\">What are Docker Images?</h2><p>Docker images are instructions written in a special file called a <code>Dockerfile</code>. It has its own syntax and defines what steps Docker will take to build your container.</p><p>Since containers are only layers upon layers of changes, each new command you create in a Docker image will create a new layer in the container. </p><p>The last layer is what we call a <strong>thin writable layer</strong>. An empty layer which can be changed by the user and committed using the <code>docker commit</code> command.</p><p>This is an example of a simple image for a Node.js application:</p><pre><code class=\"language-Dockerfile\">FROM node:stable\nCOPY . /usr/src/app/\nRUN npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build\nEXPOSE 3000\nENTRYPOINT [\"npm\", \"start\"]</code></pre><p>In this simple example, we're creating a new image. All images are based on an existing image, or a scratch image (which I explain on my blog articles in Portuguese, <a href=\"https://blog.lsantos.dev/um-mergulho-em-imagens-de-containers-parte-1/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.lsantos.dev/um-mergulho-em-imagens-de-containers-parte-2/\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.lsantos.dev/um-mergulho-em-imagens-de-containers-parte-3/\">here</a>). </p><p>These images are downloaded from a <strong>Container Registry</strong>, a repository for storing images of containers. The most common of them is the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/\">Docker Hub</a>, but you can also create a private one using cloud solutions like <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/?WT.mc_id=containers-11424-ludossan\">Azure Container Registry</a>.</p><p>When you run <code>docker build .</code> on the same directory as the Dockerfile, Docker daemon will start building the image and packaging it so you can use it. Then you can run <code>docker run &lt;image-name&gt;</code> to start a new container.</p><p>Notice that we expose certain ports in the Dockerfile. Docker allows us to separate networks within our own OS, which means you can map ports from your computer to the container and vice-versa. Also, you can execute commands inside containers with <code>docker exec</code>. </p><p>Let's put this knowledge into practice.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-deploy-your-dockerized-application\">How to Deploy your Dockerized Application</h2><p>This will be a simple and easy walkthrough on how to create a basic Docker image using a Node.js server and make it run on your computer.</p><p>First, start a new project in a directory of your choosing, and run <code>npm init -y</code> to create a new <code>package.json</code> file. Now let's create another directory called <code>src</code>. In this directory we'll create a new file called <code>server.js</code>.</p><p>Now, in your <code>package.json</code> file, change the <code>main</code> key to <code>src/server.js</code>. Also, delete the <code>test</code> script that was created and replace it with <code>\"start\": \"node src/server.js\"</code>. Your file should be like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"name\": \"your-project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"src/server.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node src/server.js\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\"\n}\n</code></pre><p>Now, create a file called <code>Dockerfile</code> (no extension). Let's write our image!</p><pre><code class=\"language-Dockerfile\">FROM node:lts-alpine\nCOPY . /usr/src/app/\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nEXPOSE 8089\nENTRYPOINT [\"npm\", \"start\"]</code></pre><p>Let's explain this:</p><ol><li>First, we're getting the node image from Docker Hub. Since images are saved by their names, we differentiate images by their tags. You can check all tags <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/node\">here</a>.</li><li>Next, we use <code>COPY</code> to copy all files in the current dir (using <code>.</code>) to a new dir in the container called <code>/usr/src/app</code>. The directory is created automatically. This is necessary because we need all our application files in there.</li><li>Now we change our start directory to the <code>/usr/src/app</code> directory, so we can run things from the root directory of our application.</li><li>We expose our port,</li><li>And we say that, as soon as our container runs, we'll execute \"npm start\".</li></ol><p>Let's build the image by running <code>docker build . -t simple-node-image</code>.

Or worse, tried to run someone else's application that needs a database that you don't have installed? </p><p>The old solution was to install the database first, then run the application. With Docker you just need to run the database container. Let's run a simple MongoDB container:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ docker run -p 27017:27017 --name my-ephemeral-db mongo\n</code></pre><p>That's it! Now you can access your database from your computer through port 27017, just like you'd do normally.</p><h3 id=\"persistent-databases\">Persistent databases</h3><p>The problem with the previous example is that, if you remove the container, all your data will be lost. So, what happens if you want to run a local database without needing to install it, but keep the data after it's deleted? You can bind Docker to a volume!</p><p>When you bind Docker to a local volume, you're essentially mounting your filesystem into the container or vice-versa. Let's see:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -v /home/my/path/to/db:/data/db --name my-persistent-db mongo\n</code></pre><p>In this command we're mounting <code>/data/db</code> into <code>/home/my/path/to/db</code>. Now if we use <code>docker stop my-persistent-db</code> and <code>docker rm my-persistent-db</code> all our data will continue to be stored there. </p><p>Later, if we need the database again, we can mount it using the same command, and all the data will be back.</p><h3 id=\"one-use-tools\">One-use tools</h3><p>Another thing that all devs do: we install applications that we only use once. For example, that simple CLI to access that old database, or that simple GUI to some CI server. </p><p>Many tools already have Docker containers, and you can use them like this, so you don't have to install yet another tool in your notebook.</p><p>The best example is Redis. It has the <code>redis-cli</code> built in another container, so you don't need to install the <code>redis-cli</code> in your shell if you hardly use it. </p><p>Let's imagine you spin up a Redis instance with <code>docker run -d --name redis redis --bind 127.0.0.1</code> bound to the localhost interface. You can access it through another container using:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ docker run --rm -it --network container:redis redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1\n</code></pre><p>The <code>--rm</code> flag tells Docker that it should remove the container as soon as it's stopped, while the <code>-it</code> flags tell it we want an interactive session (with a shell) and we'll need a TTY.</p><h3 id=\"run-entire-stacks\">Run entire stacks</h3><p>If you need to test an app that relies on another app, how would you do it? Docker makes it easy by providing <code>docker-compose</code>. It's another tool in your toolbox that allows you to code a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file which describes your environment. </p><p>The file looks like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yml\">version: \"3.8\"\nservices:\n  web:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:5000\"\n\n  redis:\n    image: \"redis:alpine\"\n    ports:\n      - \"6379:6379\"\n</code></pre><p>As you can see, we're defining two services, one is called <code>web</code> and runs <code>docker build</code> on the <code>web.build</code> path. That's a <code>Dockerfile</code>. </p><p>After that, it exposes port <code>5000</code> both in the host and in the container. The other service is <code>redis</code>, which pulls and runs the <code>redis</code> image on port <code>6379</code>. </p><p>The best part is that the network layer is shared, in other words, you can access <code>redis</code> from the <code>web</code> service by simply typing <code>redis</code> and the port.</p><p>You can start this file with a simple <code>docker-compose up</code>, and see the magic happening. </p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>That's it! This is the history of Docker, how it came to be, and how it works in 3000 words. I hope you liked it, and I hope this has made your advancement with Docker a bit easier.</p><p>As you could see, most uses of Docker are to make life easier for devs when developing applications. But there are many other uses, such as infrastructure layers and making the housekeeping of your apps a lot easier.</p><p>If you ever want to reach out to me, just ping me on any of my social networks on <a href=\"https://lsantos.dev\">my website</a>.</p><p><em>Cover photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@georgewolf?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Georg Wolf</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/whale?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

healthy and productive ways of working remotely. </p><p>Some have been sent home and can continue doing their work from there, but the \"art\" of remote work is not just about staying at home and trying to be as productive as possible. There is a whole range of techniques and best practices that can make you super productive without getting tired or exhausted.</p><p>The idea for this article came up when people asked me how I get organized and don't freak out creating articles and publishing content weekly (in addition to dealing with other issues like communities and events). </p><p>At first I didn't understand what the big deal was, as I didn't see it the same way – until more people started asking questions, as well. So I realized that this was a topic of interest to the community at large. That's when I decided to write about what I do with the hope of helping everyone who reads this.</p><h1 id=\"objective\">Objective</h1><p>This article isn't necessarily the be-all-end-all resource, but is rather intended to be a set of best practices and tips that I've collected and organized over the years.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This article is <strong>totally</strong> based on my individual experiences, so I may be missing or leaving out some things because I just haven't lived them. </p><p>In addition, all the tools that I mention throughout and the opinions about them are completely mine, based on my use and my experience. </p><p>If you have had different experiences or have a different view on personal organization, I would love to read about it in another article or on social media.</p><p>That said, let's move on to the content!</p><h1 id=\"my-history-with-personal-organization\">My History with Personal Organization</h1><p>For those who don't know me, my name is <a href=\"https://imasters.com.br/carreira-dev/dev-alem-do-codigo-lucas-santos\">Lucas Santos</a>. I currently work at <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-ludossan\">Microsoft</a> as a <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/advocates/lucas-santos?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-ludossan\">Cloud Advocate</a>, but I've been working with technology and development for almost 9 years. </p><p>But why am I telling you all this? Because I want to show where my ideas about personal organization come from and why I think they're particularly important.</p><p>During my career I have held various positions in various areas, from support to leadership. And throughout all my experience I have never worked <strong>only</strong> with development. </p><p>In other words, my work was never my <strong>only</strong> job – I've always been very involved with development communities, <a href=\"https://abcdevelopers.org\">events</a>, meetups, teaching programming, writing articles, making videos and podcasts...all while trying to manage my personal life.</p><p>Since I was little I was always a very anxious person. I was always very curious to find out how things worked and I always wanted to have control of everything. I <strong>had</strong> to know the whole process of things to be sure of what they did. It gave me a feeling of security, of knowing where I stood. </p><p>During elementary and high school, this was never a problem. But when I got to the job market and college, it started to prove quite impracticable. It is easy for you to know everything in a small company, but when things start getting big, it is out of your control. Trying to regain full control of everything is like trying to hold back a moving train with your own bare hands.</p><p>And, of course, I believed I could hold the train...</p><p>So, 2016 and 2017 were some of the most stressful years I've ever had in my entire life. I had to manage my college (at that time studying UFABC) and also my job, which had recently moved to a location in São Paulo called \"Vila Olímpia\". It was far away from my home and public transportation to get there was a pain. </p><p>This was one of the most difficult tests I had to pass. It took me almost 2 hours to get to work, so I woke up every day at 5:40 am and went straight from work to college returning at 11 pm. </p><p>Needless to say, I needed to find a way to organize everything I had to do – study for exams and my hours of sleep and leisure. But I failed miserably. In the same year, I had several health problems and several anxiety attacks. I still take an anti-anxiety pill every day.</p><p>From that point on I started to realize that it wasn't the volume of things I did or didn't do, but what I thought of them. I always thought I wasn't doing enough and that I wasn't getting where I wanted to go. </p><p>That's where that I realized that the problem was not me, but my lack of organization. And since then I have tried to evangelize personal organization to as many people as I can so that no one must go through the same problems that I went through.</p><h1 id=\"why-personal-organization-matters\">Why Personal Organization Matters</h1><p>Firstly, being organized matters because it helps to reduce (if not eliminate) your anxiety about seeing things get done - but we'll talk a little more about that in another section. </p><p>This is great for your health because it helps you avoid a lot of problems that anxiety can cause. You know that you can relax because things are planned and, if you follow your plan, everything will be ready when it should be.</p><p>Everything in life requires organization and planning, from the smallest things like your hamster's birthday to large and complex problems like distributed systems using <a href=\"https://tudosobrekubernetes.tech\">Kubernetes</a> with <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=blog-devto-ludossan\">AKS</a>. </p><p>You might be wondering - do you have to organize yourself to do <strong>everything</strong> in your life, is it an obligation? No, you can just go through the tasks one by one and do them in the order you want, storing everything in your mind. But eventually, it will end up weighing on you.</p><p>Last but not least, getting organized is a way of doing more things in less time. So it could be that those 5 things you were planning to do during the week could all be resolved in parallel in 2 days. Then you would have 3 days to do other things. </p><p>Also, getting organized includes not only having your work organized but also your personal life and your leisure time. Yes! Leisure is as important as any article or project you are going to do in your life. It needs to have time in your agenda at any cost. But if you do not plan for it, you'll always end up pushing it to the last priority and then your anxiety will come back again.</p><h2 id=\"advantages-of-personal-organization\">Advantages of Personal Organization</h2><p>Let's summarize what we talked about in small topics. What are the advantages of personal organization?</p><ul><li>Reduces anxiety and stress caused by not having control of things</li><li>Creates a growing organization <em>mindset</em> that allows you to extend your organization psychology to other areas and other people</li><li>Increases your efficiency, enabling you to do more things in less time</li><li>Frees up time to accomplish more things and, consequently, gives you more time for yourself</li><li>Creates healthy organization and filing habits that allow you to search for and find things much faster</li><li>Generates responsibility</li><li>Induces self-control and discipline</li></ul><h2 id=\"difficulties-of-personal-organization\">Difficulties of Personal Organization</h2><p>Getting organized is not a simple task and therefore takes a long time. Personal organization goes far beyond calendars and task lists – we have to create habits. And <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/new-habit\">it has already been proven</a> that a new habit takes at least 21 days to be formed. </p><p>We also need to create discipline, avoid procrastination, and do a lot of other things that involve not only a mental but also a physical change.</p><p>Many things can undermine our personal organization that we don't even notice, for example:</p><ul><li>Procrastination, the act of leaving something to be done later when there is no punishment for not performing a task</li><li>Mental tiredness</li><li>Physical tiredness</li><li>Lack of prioritization</li><li>Lack of definition in tasks</li><li>Problems with self-discipline (after all, not all people can organize themselves to the point of creating discipline and taking people seriously)</li></ul><p>And a lot of other stuff.</p><p>Let's make it scientific and see how our brain works.</p><h2 id=\"the-psychology-behind-personal-organization\">The Psychology Behind Personal Organization</h2><p>The brain is an impressively complex computer full of secrets that we have yet to discover. However, we have managed to create analogies very similar to computers. </p><p>Just like you often have a series of tasks running at the same time on your personal computer – mine, for example, now has a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/edge?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-ludossan\">browser</a>, the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=blog-devto-ludossan\">editor</a> where I am writing this article, and some communication apps - everything seems to be running at the same time. But in fact, the processor is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch\">switching between tasks</a> very quickly, that is, essentially it is running only one task at a time.</p><p>The same is true of our brain. Although it appears that we can perform several tasks at the same time, the brain <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224943\">can only perform two cognitively complex tasks simultaneously</a>. </p><p>So many people think that the act of <em>multitasking</em> is beneficial and efficient when, in fact, it is more harmful than beneficial. A classic example is trying to talk on the phone while typing something different. Or writing an email while talking to someone about another subject. This is because the channels that process speech are the same and there is only one of them. </p><p>And that explains why we can tie a knot or play a song and sing at the same time: the voice and the motor channels that are responsible for the movement of the strings are different.</p><p>When we do this unconsciously, we call it <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2U93xiI\">task switching</a>, otherwise, we call it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_shifting\">cognitive shifting</a>.</p><p>Besides, there is this concept called your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\">attention span</a> which is the measure of time that a human being remains focused on a particular task. <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-ludossan\">Microsoft Canada</a> published <a href=\"http://dl.motamem.org/microsoft-attention-spans-research-report.pdf\">a study in 2015</a> which says that the average time that a human being remains attentive to a task is about 8 seconds. And this is super important for what we are going to talk about next.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hyl7mtcbq1ltg0m6jnjk.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Attention Span\" width=\"701\" height=\"741\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Of course, this can change according to the type of task we are doing. Apparently, when a task is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\">motivating or pleasant,</a> we can have up to 20 minutes of attention. </p><p>And why is this important? Simply because we now have a time limit in which we must accomplish our tasks to stay efficient and organized. That is, we cannot create tasks that exceed 20 minutes.</p><p>This forces us to break larger tasks into smaller tasks. And that by itself forces us to detail everything we do, creating a better description of what we need to do. It also makes us eliminate useless tasks or ridiculous items that may seem important at first glance.</p><p>And that is the first step towards personal organization: <strong>Know exactly what you need to do.</strong></p><p>When you have a cloudy task or one that does not seem very explicit, you simply cannot develop that task on time. So you need to create another task just to be able to think better about this first one. This means you have a task for the planning of the next task, which was exactly what I did when writing this article.</p><p>I wanted to write content about personal organization, but I didn't know where to start. So for two weeks, I leaned over it and researched possible topics I could talk about and write about, always taking notes.</p><p>Since I'm Brazilian, my organization notes are in Portuguese, but you get the point...</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/f2nm0zxn6ows6m6bz6l2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Content Organizing\" width=\"806\" height=\"744\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h1 id=\"initial-tips\">Initial Tips</h1><p>For this part of the article, I will focus more on the discipline you should develop throughout this process. We'll work on organizing ourselves as people, so I'll leave the discussion of specific tools and methodologies to the next part.</p><p>Everything I will talk about here is based on what I have experienced throughout the years.</p><h3 id=\"avoid-half-words-and-open-contexts-always-know-exactly-what-needs-to-be-done\">Avoid half words and open contexts. Always know exactly what needs to be done</h3><p>Make sure your tasks are very well defined to the smallest detail. <em>\"Talk to John\"</em> is not a well-defined task – you need to make extremely clear everything you need to do, with as much detail as possible. </p><p>For example, <em>\"Talk to John about the insurance policy and ask for the payment to be sent on the 23rd\" </em>is much more specific and clear.</p><h3 id=\"your-brain-is-not-a-hard-drive-it-is-not-reliable\">Your brain is not a hard drive, it is not reliable</h3><p>Do you remember what you were doing at this very moment 3 years ago? No? Of course you don't. Our memory is unreliable, so <strong>always</strong> note down everything <strong>AT THE MOMENT YOU THINK OF IT.</strong> Do not wait until later, and never say the phrase <em>\"Later I'll write this down\"</em>.</p><p>Always write everything down in as much detail as possible somewhere to get it out of your brain. </p><p>One day I talked to a friend, <a href=\"https://pothix.com/about/\">William \"PotHix\" Molinari</a> - who is also a developer on one of the organization tools I like most. He gave me one of the coolest tips: </p><blockquote><em>\"Your brain is made to process, not to memorize, so take everything you need to remember it and put it in another more reliable channel, like paper\"</em>.</blockquote><h3 id=\"be-disciplined\">Be Disciplined</h3><p>Personal organization is highly guided by self-discipline and responsibility, so you need to take it as part of your job.</p><p>Some people have a hard time turning something personal into a responsibility. Because, after all, nobody is going to fight with you or pull your hair out because you missed or delayed a personal task. You are your own manager. </p><p>But this is both good and bad, mainly because you need to be a little hard on yourself to be productive and efficient. Remember, the only person to blame for your failures is you and no one else.</p><p>Therefore, the responsibility of building up discipline – for both large and small tasks – is yours and only yours. So create consequences for yourself if you fail to meet your expectations: \"I will not watch my series today because I have not completed my tasks\", or \"I will turn off the Internet because I delayed this task \".</p><h3 id=\"everything-is-a-task\">EVERYTHING is a task</h3><p>We'll talk about this later, but <strong>everything</strong> can be considered a task, from cleaning up the leaves in the garden to working towards world peace. So write down everything you need to do and make extreme use of <em>to do</em> lists. </p><p>Don't be ashamed to ask friends to send invites for that Sunday barbecue, and live by the principle: <em>\"If it's not on my calendar or in my to-do list, it doesn't exist.\"</em></p><h3 id=\"keep-it-simple\">Keep it Simple</h3><p>We just talked about writing it all down. But there's no use in just putting down a task with the title <em>\"Achieve world peace\". </em> That's too big and vague. We will talk more about this below, but always try to break big tasks into small tasks – remember, 20 minutes or less. This way you'll always know what to do.</p><h3 id=\"everything-has-a-deadline\">Everything has a deadline</h3><p>I'm a programmer, and I hate working with <em>deadlines</em> because I want my system even more robust and more perfect. But unfortunately, in our lives, everything needs an end date. </p><p>All tasks you create need to have a date and/or time to finish. If you don't finish by then, you have failed your plan and need to rethink how you are organizing yourself.</p><p>It takes a while to understand your rhythm. For example, I am a human amoeba before 9 am, so I know I will not be able to complete anything very complex before this time. So I plan the most complicated and demanding tasks with greater cognitive load for after midday. </p><p>Before that I perform minor tasks such as: replying to emails, reading some articles I have on my read list, watching some YouTube lesson, organizing folders and files, and so on.</p><h3 id=\"grow-beyond-your-fear-of-the-future\">Grow beyond your fear of the future</h3><p>This goes beyond the personal organization of tasks. But the big problem is that we think we will use something in the future and we end up keeping it – for example, I have a folder full of floppy disks here, which I keep only because of sheer nostalgia.</p><p>But professional organizer Mia Lotringer showed <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200603/how-get-organized-finally\">in this excellent article</a> a very interesting way to organize yourself physically and virtually with your files:</p><ol><li>Overcome your fear of throwing things away or deleting files.</li><li>Put everything you think you will need in the future in a box with a destruction date, usually 6 months from the current date.</li><li>If you need to take something out of there and use it before this final period, take that thing out of the box and put it in another box with a longer destruction period, 1 year for example.</li><li>If you need to take this item out of the 1-year-box again, then keep it, because you are using it for real.</li><li>If not, when the date arrives, throw everything in the boxes away.</li></ol><h3 id=\"do-have-a-place-to-organize-your-tasks\">Do have a place to organize your tasks</h3><p>We will talk about tools and software in a bit, but for now, <strong>always</strong> have a place to write down and get your tasks ready, with dates and descriptions. It can be a notebook, a calendar, a planner (which I never understood how to use), whatever. The most important thing is not the medium, but the <strong>habit</strong>.</p><p>You can write everything down on scratch paper, as long as you look at it daily. That is, as long as you create the habit of looking at and completing your tasks every day, no matter where you leave them, that's fine. But remember that we take at least 21 days to create habits. </p><h3 id=\"organize-physically\">Organize Physically</h3><p>Everything I'm talking about here seems to be linked to tasks and things to do, but your workplace and your physical space must be organized. Nobody can do anything in a very cluttered environment because it creates a lot of visual pollution that ends up distracting your mind.</p><h3 id=\"focus-strength-and-faith-but-mainly-focus\">Focus, strength, and faith. But mainly focus</h3><p>Have <strong>focus</strong> on the things you are doing. For focus, I say: <em>Do only one thing at a time</em>. Don't try to embrace the world and do five things at the same time, choose one task, do it to the end, then go on to another.</p><h3 id=\"small-tasks-right-away-\">Small tasks right away!</h3><p>If you have a task that takes 2 minutes or less – like sending an email, answering a person, asking for information, changing something – do it instantly. These tasks don't even have to be on your to-do list, just do them as soon as you think about them.</p><p>This is an exception to the previous note where I put that everything should be on the list. Because the time it'd take for you to write a small task on the list is the same amount of time you would spend finishing said task.</p><h1 id=\"tools-of-the-trade\">Tools of The Trade</h1><p>Since we've now covered a bit about <strong>what</strong> personal organization is, now we're going to talk about <strong>how </strong>to get organized – in detail! It's all about the tools you choose to make your life easier, and about your own self-discipline.</p><h2 id=\"what-should-i-organize\">What Should I Organize?</h2><p>We are always saying <strong>\"Ah, we need to organize\"</strong> but <strong>what</strong> needs to be organized? Your life. Okay... But what makes up your life?</p><p>This will vary from person to person, but try to do an interesting reflection exercise: Sit (or stand) and list all the things you usually do for a whole day. After that, try to list with what you interact to accomplish such a task, for example:</p><ul><li>Answer emails (<em>the interaction here would be with email</em>)</li><li>Fix the calendar (<em>The interaction here would be with the agenda</em>)</li><li>Pay bills (<em>The bills would be the interaction</em>)</li></ul><p>And so on...</p><p>You will find that, in general, a person does not need to organize more than three things: e-mails, Calendar and Tasks. </p><p>However, it is important to say that within these items we can have a series of different categories where we can create other items that should be treated differently. </p><p>For example, I am constantly involved with events, articles, publications and code, so the tools that I use the most are the calendar, e-mails and text editors. But I can't just categorize everything as an event on the agenda – I have several categories that need to be treated differently.</p><p>In this way I prefer to say that the items that need to be organized are:</p><h3 id=\"tasks\">Tasks</h3><ul><li>E-mails</li><li>Notes and documents</li></ul><h3 id=\"schedule\">Schedule</h3><ul><li>In-person events</li><li>Online events</li><li>External work (freelance)</li><li>Daily tasks (personal or work-related)</li><li>Bills</li><li>Personal commitments</li><li>Rest times (leisure, hobbies)</li><li>Neutral time (<em>free time</em>)</li></ul><p>So, we've arrived at the biggest controversy on the agenda: Should we organize and plan for our leisure time? <strong>Yes!</strong> It is free time like any other, and we will talk more about it in the following paragraphs. But the idea is that your agenda should not have \"empty\" slots. Everything should be occupied with something you would like to do.</p><p>And then we have another super valid question: <em>But if I plan my leisure time will it stop being leisure time?</em></p><p>Well, why would it? Just because you put your free time on the agenda to do what you want, does not mean that you are methodically transforming it into a formal work-time that must be followed to the letter.</p><p>You see, the idea of ​​personal organization is not only valid for work tasks – it is just the opposite. Personal organization means taking control of your time so that you know exactly how to make the best use of it. All your time must be contained in your personal organization methods. </p><p>You can only take control of your time if <strong>all</strong> of it is being planned, otherwise you will have planning gaps and this will impact your life.</p><p>We will now dissect these most important topics.</p><h2 id=\"schedule-1\">Schedule</h2><p>The agenda is your best friend in personal organization. Remember organization's biggest motto:</p><blockquote><strong>If it is not on the agenda, it does not exist</strong></blockquote><p>You just can't forget to add something to the agenda, because otherwise you will have an increasing number of things that \"don't exist\" and you will often forget things. </p><p>This will make it feel like the methodology you are using is not working, but it's nothing like that. It's all about habits, which we'll talk about later.</p><h3 id=\"tools\">Tools</h3><p>The work you do is as good as the tools you have, so let's talk a little bit about the scheduling tools we have available to us:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://calendar.google.com\">Google Calendar</a>: This is my choice for the sake of convenience. Calendar is already integrated with Gmail email accounts (which I use as my primary account), so it’s extremely comfortable to use</li><li><a href=\"https://office.live.com/start/Calendar.aspx\">Outlook Calendar</a>: The same thing as Google Calendar for <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/office/client-developer/outlook/outlook-home?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Outlook</a> users as your primary email account</li><li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/calendar\">Apple Calendar</a>: Again, the exact same thing for users of Apple accounts as main email accounts</li></ul><p>For these tools, I really recommend that you stick to one of these three for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>All are linked to an email account, which makes management easier. Remember: always try to use the <strong>smallest possible number of tools.</strong></li><li>They are all synchronized in the cloud, so it is very difficult for you to lose any of your data. Also, it is much easier to migrate from one device to another.</li><li>All of them have web clients.</li></ul><p>And now we come to the most important point: <strong>All the calendars support the import of external calendars</strong>. This is important because, most of the time, you will have a personal agenda and a work schedule. I also recommend that you have an agenda for each type of task that you do. </p><p>This means it's important that <strong>you center all your schedules in one single place.</strong> This makes management easier as long as the schedules are <strong>synchronized.</strong> This means that if I change, for example, my work schedule from my personal schedule it propagates the change to the original schedule. </p><p>Sounds complicated? Let's look at an example:</p><p>Let's say I change an event on my work schedule from my personal schedule. For example, from my personal schedule I change my RSVP from \"yes\" to \"no\" for a work meeting. This change must be propagated to the work agenda where the event must say that I will no longer be present.</p><p>This is possible because most calendars use the <a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV\">CalDAV</a> protocol, which is a standard communication protocol for remote calendars.</p><p>If you are not happy with the default views of your chosen calendar you can always download a client that you can modify. You can even include other options and features. </p><p>For example, if you do not like to access via the web, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/misc/set-up-outlook-to-read-email?view=o365-worldwide&amp;WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Outlook</a> has an excellent <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-edgehtml/get-started?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">PWA</a> (see how to do it <a href=\"https://www.thewindowsclub.com/install-outlook-on-the-web-as-a-pwa\">here</a>). It is also possible, through Chrome's <a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-chrome-create-windows-10-app-website/\">web apps</a>, to turn any website into a desktop application.</p><h2 id=\"organizing-the-agenda\">Organizing the agenda</h2><p>Organizing your agenda is very important, as it will be from there that you get all of your own personal organization. Therefore, the agenda is the main point of all our \"theory\" here.</p><h3 id=\"have-a-different-schedule-for-each-activity\">Have a different schedule for each activity</h3><p>When we create a calendar in any of the tools described above, we automatically get a calendar called \"Calendar\". However, this does not mean that we must stick to a single calendar on the same agenda, and we shouldn't.</p><p>It is good practice to create a new calendar – or a new agenda, depending on your platform – for each type of activity you participate in. See how <strong>I</strong> organize my agendas:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GkzrEkv-rbm1_ls1pq89Cm8Tt7FVago_\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1GkzrEkv-rbm1_ls1pq89Cm8Tt7FVago_\" width=\"221\" height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>My agendas, they're in Portuguese because I'm Brazilian</figcaption></figure><p><em>Since the calendar is in Portuguese, I'll be putting the translated names in the list, and the original names in parentheses:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Personal (Pessoal):</strong> This is the standard calendar that I renamed to be my personal calendar. In it I mark all my personal commitments and those that do not fit in any other agenda.</li><li><strong>Confirmed Events (Eventos confirmados):</strong> In this calendar I mark the events that I am sure I will participate in, such as meetups, lectures, conferences, webinars, podcasts...</li><li><strong>Unconfirmed events (Eventos não confirmados):</strong> Here are the <em>\"Save the date\"</em> for the events that I have submitted proposals for lectures or that I am on the verge of participating in, but are not yet fully confirmed.</li><li><strong>SP Events (Eventos SP)</strong>: In this calendar I mark other events that I will participate but not as a speaker or staff, just as a listener. This is a shared agenda among several people who organize events in São Paulo, so it serves more as a guide for avoid scheduling events on the same days.</li><li><strong>Family (Família):</strong> This is an agenda that I share with my parents and other people in my family so that we can know the days that everyone is busy.</li><li><strong>Freelance (Freelas):</strong> Here is an agenda to schedule delivery dates for side projects and also important meetings with clients.</li><li><strong>Tasks</strong> <strong>(Tarefas)</strong>: This is undoubtedly the most important agenda, as this is where I synchronize my tasks with my to-do list.</li></ul><h3 id=\"add-some-color\">Add some color</h3><p>It's much easier to identify and check what's going on when you add color to your calendars and tasks. This way it is possible to see much more clearly what is taking up more of your time. </p><p>It is possible to see through the colors of my calendars what belongs to which category:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Nbn0RknkllOPN66NXh1h7PjcX0bFQ4vU\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1Nbn0RknkllOPN66NXh1h7PjcX0bFQ4vU\" width=\"1587\" height=\"872\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Note that there are tasks to the left of other tasks – this is because they are items originally added to the calendar that have the color of this category. You can see that those items that have a gray border have been added to the \"tasks\" calendar. But I colored it myself with another color. I usually color each of these items by category, so I know right away what I will need to do on certain days.</p><p>In addition, coloring the items in your calendar helps you understand where you are spending the most time. For example, the light green items that are very present in the calendar are part of my agenda for work meetings (so you can see that my days are almost all permeated by meetings).</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/misc/set-up-outlook-to-read-email?view=o365-worldwide&amp;WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Outlook</a> also allows you to <a href=\"https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/calendar/add-charm-outlook-meetings/\">add icons</a> to your events to make them even easier to find.</p><h3 id=\"go-beyond-the-task\">Go beyond the task</h3><p>Planning tasks on your calendar doesn't just include creating the item and putting it on your calendar. There are other factors that need to be considered:</p><ul><li>Travel time</li><li>Unforeseen</li><li>Ease of getting to the location</li><li>Distance</li></ul><p>All this needs to be considered so that your planning is efficient. H ere are some important topics on how to think beyond what you need to do:</p><ul><li><strong>Measure travel time:</strong> Some calendars (such as Apple's iCalendar) have the ability to add a travel time, so the event is filled with a bit of extra time that makes up the travel time to the location. If you don't have that in your agenda, create another travel schedule or try to always take into account that all tasks that are outside your home require some time until you reach the place.</li><li><strong>Make use of the address:</strong> Whenever you can, include the address where the event will be taking place. This way most schedules can already let you know how long it takes to arrive at the place in advance.</li><li><strong>The 15-minute rule:</strong> Always mark items on your calendar as starting 15 or so minutes before the actual start time, so you will never be late for an appointment.</li><li><strong>Make use of notifications:</strong> Add notifications when the event is coming, and always more than one! This can be configured by schedule as a default and by event.</li></ul><h3 id=\"unforeseen-events-happen\">Unforeseen events happen</h3><p>Always be ready to revisit your schedule to reorganize your tasks daily. Unforeseen events happen, plans change, so the agenda can never be written in stone. You need to have a certain flexibility in everything you can do.</p><p>It is not a lack of planning to change your agenda. On the contrary, the ability to adapt to what is happening shows a remarkably high level of personal organization.</p><h3 id=\"look-down-the-road\">Look down the road</h3><p>Do not stick to scheduling only events that will happen in the next week. Plan and schedule <strong>ALL</strong> the events that will happen and that already have a date, including events that will happen the following year.</p><h3 id=\"there-is-no-bad-schedule\">There is no bad schedule</h3><p>There is no task that cannot be scheduled. Always put <strong>ALL</strong> of them on your agenda, from your least favorites to the biggest conferences. Remember: <em>\"If it's not on the agenda, it doesn't exist\"</em></p><h4 id=\"schedule-your-free-time\">Schedule your free time</h4><p>As we said before, it is super important to schedule the time you have for you. So enjoy and schedule free time so that you do not schedule other things over it.</p><p>Also, always schedule your lunch time in your personal and company calendar. That way other people (and even yourself) are unable to schedule things at these times.</p><h3 id=\"be-sensible-with-schedules\">Be sensible with schedules</h3><p>That meeting never starts at 10 am sharp...how frustrating. It's always complicated to work with other people and schedules, so try your hardest to stick to the <strong>time you planned for things.</strong> </p><p>But always try to give yourself some time between your tasks so that you don't get overwhelmed.</p><h3 id=\"focus-time\">Focus time</h3><p>Every day, try to schedule some time just to focus. During this time, only dedicate yourself to what is scheduled. That is, don't respond to messages, don't answer emails (unless, of course, these are your focus tasks).</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/insights-in-outlook?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Outlook has an extension</a> called Insights which, among other very cool things, allows you to schedule focus time weekly. In addition to it, there are other programs like <a href=\"https://rescuetime.com\">RescueTime</a> that allow you to analyze your daily productivity:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BFlhdOEzkikQklAm01jmx1KUIwed0FXk\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1BFlhdOEzkikQklAm01jmx1KUIwed0FXk\" width=\"1057\" height=\"466\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>And this brings us to another important topic.</p><h3 id=\"look-for-tools-that-help-you\">Look for tools that help you</h3><p>The most important mantra I bring to life is that we must keep things simple. This means we should only use a small, but efficient, number of tools. </p><p>For several months I searched for and tested several tools, some of which did not give me much benefit. But I found others, such as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/insights-in-outlook?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Insights</a> and <a href=\"https://rescuetime.com\">RescueTime</a>, that showed me super interesting things.</p><h3 id=\"understand-your-time\">Understand your time</h3><p>In addition to having insights, seeing the bigger picture is very important. Other tools like <a href=\"https://wakatime.com/\">WakaTime</a> allow you to have exact control over what you are doing and where you spend most of your time (and what you’re doing in the meantime). </p><p>Tools like this can help you get ideas on how to improve your personal organization on your own.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rApImye9pdkPHZFG_8VUg_TQc9evItqz\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1rApImye9pdkPHZFG_8VUg_TQc9evItqz\" width=\"1706\" height=\"794\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In the case of <a href=\"https://rescuetime.com\">RescueTime</a>, it has extensions for your computer, cell phone, and tablet that analyze the types of thing you do and classify them as productive time or not. </p><p>It's all configurable, and can show, for example, how many times have you taken your cell phone out to look at it during the day. It also helps you set goals that you can strive to follow during the week.</p><p>It is important to note that these tools work based on data, so you need to use them for a long time (at least two months) before deciding if they really work or not. So, give them time to adjust.</p><h2 id=\"emails\">Emails</h2><p>One of the great villains of personal organization? Emails. In the past 20 years, email has become <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/study-shows-email-marketing-still-popular-and-effective-with-millennials.html\">one of the most popular forms of communication</a>. However, they also fill not only your inbox but also your time. After all, they are many...</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/3wlade.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"3wlade\" width=\"500\" height=\"501\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Time and necessity has led us to develop a methodology for dealing with e-mails called <a href=\"https://blog.trello.com/br/inbox-zero\">inbox zero</a> in addition to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/growth-center/resources/7-email-management-tips-to-achieve-inbox-zero?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc- ludossan\">other important techniques</a>.</p><h3 id=\"inbox-zero\">Inbox Zero</h3><p>All emails are tasks that require action. Writer and podcaster Merlin Mann created the inbox zero model a long time ago and, to this day, it is one of the most efficient ways to deal with e-mails. </p><p>The goal of this methodology is simple: to zero out your inbox every day so that you don't have any pending issues.</p><p>For this, all e-mail can have four actions that can be taken:</p><ul><li><strong>Exclude:</strong> Is there nothing you can do? Doesn't it concern you? Will you never need to return to this email again? Delete or archive it – always remember to <a href=\"https://www.simpletivity.com/blog/why-you-should-never-leave-email-in-your-inbox\">never leave an email read in your inbox</a>.</li><li><strong>Delegate:</strong> If the email came to you, but you are not the best person to resolve the demand, then forward this email to someone else who can resolve it. This does not mean that you automatically become the manager. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200603/how-get-organized-finally\">In this 2016 article</a> personal organizer Mia Lotringer says it is especially important to pass the ball over to the neighbor as you're able, avoid having pending issues.</li><li><strong>Send/Plan:</strong> The postponement - or, as I like to call, planning - of email is one of the coolest features that existed in the old (but gold) Google Inbox, which applied the <em>inbox zero</em> technique perfectly! If the email takes more than two minutes to respond, then it is best that you postpone it to a specific date where you can respond calmly and pick up all the items needed for a decent response. Today, both Gmail and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/the-new-outlook-for-mac-6283be54-e74d-434e-babb-b70cefc77439\">new Outlook</a> have e-mail postponement functionality. I like to go deeper than that, though – in addition to postponing the email, I also add a task for it in my favorite task system (both <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/ 106237?Co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">Gmail</a> and <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-tasks-in-outlook-on-the-web-f8d35330-64e4-4a7b-bcdc-8d85906e7a24\">Outlook Web</a>).</li><li><strong>Do:</strong> Otherwise, if the email takes less than two minutes to answer or it can be answered right away, don't waste time moving it, just reply and file.</li></ul><h3 id=\"schedule-your-inbox-zero\">Schedule your inbox zero</h3><p>Like any task, inbox zero is a daily action that needs to be performed. But most people have a habit of checking e-mails several times during the day. It's been <a href=\"https:/www.nytimes.com /2015/01/11/opinion/sunday/stop-checking-email-so-often.html\">proven</a> by researchers at Columbia University, that checking e-mail just three times a day can greatly decrease your stress level.</p><p>In my case, I usually check e-mail once at nine in the morning, when I start to work. The whole process takes no more than 30 minutes, so at 9:30 am I'm already free. After that I check again after lunch, around 1 pm and, finally, in the late afternoon at 5:30 pm before marking the day as finished.</p><h3 id=\"emails-are-tasks\">Emails are tasks</h3><p>Do not forget that every email asks for an action. This action can be quick or time consuming. If the action takes time it becomes a task that must be scheduled in your task system and <strong>placed on your agenda</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"tasks-1\">Tasks</h2><p>We've now arrived where everyone thinks the problem lies: the task list! There are several very well-tested methodologies that'll help you make your personal organization work.</p><p>Initially we can say that task lists are very necessary, because humans adapt better when we have a list of objective and concrete things that we need to do. This way we don't always need to be thinking. </p><p>Your tasks should be:</p><ul><li>Simple</li><li>Concise</li><li>Straightforward</li></ul><h3 id=\"choosing-your-tool\">Choosing your tool</h3><p>Here are a series of tools that exist to organize tasks. As I said earlier, the secret to finding efficiency is to use as few tools as possible that you use well. And this efficiency comes from integrating your tools so that they all work as one. </p><p>Let's start with the native tools of the calendar systems we mentioned before.</p><ul><li>The first is <a href=\"https://todo.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Microsoft To Do</a> which is already <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-microsoft-to-do-with-tasks-from-outlook-c7a0253d-b8cc-4054-b94b-c194e0e5308a?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">integrated</a> with Outlook and, consequently, to the calendar. It also has mobile applications, in addition to integrating very well with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/insights-in-outlook?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Insights</a>.</li><li>Then we have <a href=\"https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">Google Tasks</a>, which is also integrated with both Gmail and Google Calendar and has mobile apps.</li><li>Finally, we have Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/reminders/welcome/mac\">Reminders</a>, which perform the same functions. While it is not directly integrated with calendar, it is synchronized and native to all Apple devices.</li></ul><p>These three tools make up the simplest integrations that can be done, as they are native to the platforms themselves. If you are a beginner (or even have been organizing for a while), I recommend starting here.</p><p>There are other options for those who want to follow a more Kanban-like model, such as <a href=\"https://trello.com\">Trello</a>. Check it out.</p><p>However, when I first started working on personal organization these apps did not exist yet. So I ended up going to another tool, which is still one of the tools I like the most: <strong><a href=\"https://todoist.com\">Todoist</a></strong>.</p><p>For me, Todoist was the right choice because it is quite simple. It's just a task list that allows you to include some type of tags and create several categories, which are called projects:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fudzFLvua1ADFZVGDyYqfTMiSlqKHkvh\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1fudzFLvua1ADFZVGDyYqfTMiSlqKHkvh\" width=\"226\" height=\"791\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I was looking for a system where I could write down all my tasks, as well as set deadlines and be reminded of them. Todoist gave me much more than I needed. </p><p>In addition to having excellent applications for web, desktop and mobile, it also has integrations with Google Calendar. This means that all events I create on a private calendar become tasks in Todoist and all tasks in Todoist become items in my calendar.</p><p>In addition, it allows you to tag your tasks to find them more easily later on. Also, if you are on a project with multiple people, it is possible to share one or more projects with other users for everyone to use.</p><h2 id=\"small-tips-about-tools\">Small tips about tools</h2><p>Here are some small tips I picked up while using various task management apps.</p><h3 id=\"you-have-a-limit\">You have a limit</h3><p>We all have a limit on the number of tasks we can do each day, be it a time limit or a cognitive one. We cannot force ourselves to do too many complex tasks at once in a single day. </p><p>And this limit is defined by each one of us, there is no magic number. Do not try to include twenty-five tasks in one day, as you won't end up completing all of them. This will give the you the false impression that you have not organized yourself properly.</p><p>To try to find out what your daily limit is, try applying the <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation\">Scrum point technique</a> of applying tags to each task according to their difficulty. At the end of the week count the points for the <strong>full tasks</strong> and write them down. At the end of the month make an average of the number of points you tallied and you will have your estimated number.</p><h3 id=\"measure-time\">Measure time</h3><p>One of the most helpful things we can do for our own personal organization is measure the amount of time we spend on each task. We can do this with tools like <a href=\"https://toggl.com\">Toggl</a> - which, by the way, has <a href=\"https://toggl.com/blog/tag/comics\">a blog full of amazing comics</a> - and measure exactly how much time we spend on each of the tasks we perform. You can also integrate the tool with Todoist or others.</p><p>However, from my point of view, time measurement is a bit too extreme when we are doing personal organization. This is because, at least for me, it didn't give me any interesting insights, and I often forgot to start the timer.</p><h3 id=\"the-more-detailed-the-better\">The more detailed the better</h3><p>As we said earlier, your tasks should be simple, but at the same time concise. So try to make your to-do titles very descriptive without writing too much. &nbsp;Then you can comment on the tasks and attach everything you need to carry them out.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ARXF2jygiM2QWuR8A0vOM0Nj3ccGxLYe\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1ARXF2jygiM2QWuR8A0vOM0Nj3ccGxLYe\" width=\"395\" height=\"294\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Describe your tasks in a way you can understand them later</figcaption></figure><p>I can't say much about the other task management tools, as I've never used them much, but Todoist allows us to add comments and attach files to our tasks. </p><p>So, when creating a task, describe it with a quick and concise title, but leave a comment with as much detail as possible. Also attach <strong>any</strong> files that are needed, even if these files are already elsewhere. </p><p>Let's jump to one example: I received an email about a document that I needed to review and return to the sender. But I needed to ask someone else to also review the document after my review. So what would my task flow be?</p><ol><li>Create a task \"Analyze documents from email X\" with a scheduled date and time</li><li>I would add the task in a project in Todoist</li><li>I would comment out the context for the task – that way I can return to it at any time and I'd know what was happening and what the context was that I have to follow</li><li>Attach the document <strong>and email</strong> to the task</li><li>Create another task \"Send the document to Y\" and comment on the context of that task by writing down the email and the person I must send the answer to in this same comment</li></ol><h3 id=\"divide-and-conquer\">Divide and conquer</h3><p>As we saw in the beginning, the human attention span is approximately 20 minutes, so we can't create tasks that are too long. To help with this, most tools offer us a sub task system, where we can include a larger task and several small tasks.</p><p>Let's take the previous example and do it in a more organized way:</p><ol><li>Create a task \"Analyze documents from the email X\" with a scheduled date and time</li><li>I would add the task in a Todoist project</li><li>I would comment on a context for the task, that way I can return to it at any time that I will know what was happening and what is the context that I have to follow</li><li>Attachment <strong>the email</strong> in the task</li><li>I create a sub-task \"Analyze document Z\"</li><li>Attach the document to the task</li><li>I create another sub task \"Send the document to Y\" and comment on the context of that task by writing the email and the person I have to send the answer to in this same comment</li></ol><p>We could create another sub task to follow-up with the person after a certain time or even another one to re-analyze and respond. All with scheduled date-time and included in the same project.</p><h2 id=\"notes-and-anything-else\">Notes and anything else</h2><p>In addition to what we must do, it is important to know what we are currently doing and take notes. And, even more important than taking notes, we should keep these notes simply and efficiently so we can return to them later.</p><p>In this section I will just leave a list of tools that I have used, but you'll have to choose what works best for you.</p><h3 id=\"github\"><a href=\"https://github.com\">Github</a></h3><p>If you have study notes or anything that is public, or even private, you can keep them in a GitHub repository - like <a href=\"https://github.com/khaosdoctor/my-notes/\">I do</a> - and they will be secure and versioned.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YCCs5KpdgyAPEO3nCbRkoWEpP_staflb\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1YCCs5KpdgyAPEO3nCbRkoWEpP_staflb\" width=\"1002\" height=\"951\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"google-keep\"><a href=\"https://keep.google.com\">Google Keep</a></h3><p>Keep is an excellent tool for organizing your notes on the post-its model – and it even supports to-dos! I personally used it for a long time before migrating to another tool that suited me better. </p><p>From my point of view, Keep is the balance between functionality and simplicity. The problem is that it is a bit heavy and does not have that many features.</p><h3 id=\"notion\"><a href=\"https://notion.so\">Notion</a></h3><p>I used Google Keep for many years until I discovered Notion. This is essentially a tool that includes <strong>everything.</strong> You can make tables, calendars, plan projects and everything. It is really an excellent tool and today it is my tool of choice for anything I need to keep. And it has apps for any platform.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DOeMCUN2oExy1x2aC8g9G7qz-ePi7IDD\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1DOeMCUN2oExy1x2aC8g9G7qz-ePi7IDD\" width=\"396\" height=\"614\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I use this app today to organize my list of content that I am writing (including this article) and also that I will write in the future. I keep lists of talks and ideas for talks I have, streams, songs I want to practice, other important notes, and so on.</p><blockquote>No, this article is unfortunately not sponsored by Notion ?</blockquote><p>Another nice thing about Notion is that you can import content from other tools natively, and you can also count on a series of templates to create what you want without having to think too much:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Da_oPvAomaz82E4HdG7EBT0iXamzjjtc\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1Da_oPvAomaz82E4HdG7EBT0iXamzjjtc\" width=\"2598\" height=\"1628\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>It also has many forms of customization, including dynamic organization filters:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mUjR9oIS-CL_N3TSfR7XQsXQ6oFu4-Ow\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"uc?id=1mUjR9oIS-CL_N3TSfR7XQsXQ6oFu4-Ow\" width=\"2520\" height=\"810\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Yes, I delayed the publication of this article... But unforeseen events happen, and you need to be prepared for them.</p><h3 id=\"native-notes\">Native Notes</h3><p>You can also use the native notes application on your computer/cell phone. In the case of Apple we are talking about Notes, but all cellphones have a native notes application.</p><h1 id=\"methodologies\">Methodologies</h1><p>Now that we've talked about tooling, best practices, tips and tricks, let's jump into the methods of organizing yourself.</p><p>Methodology is the study of a method, or a study of ways to reach a final goal. Methodologies help us follow a path in a more organized and concrete way instead of trial and error. After all, they are precisely the study of these attempts.</p><p>It is important to say that if a methodology fits perfectly with what you are doing, then you are probably doing it wrong. This is because the methodologies were created to give us a guide on how to behave, but not to dictate how we should carry out our tasks. In most cases a methodology will need to be adapted or even modified according to your needs.</p><h3 id=\"why-to-use-a-methodology\">Why to use a methodology?</h3><p>Over all the years I tried to organize myself, I tried to create methods and activities that would make me more efficient in personal organization. But this is not always the best way to go about it – we often discover very efficient methods, but impractical, and vice versa.</p><p>After a while, I found out that other people had the same problems as I did, and had different ideas on how to treat them. So I started to learn a little more about methodologies.</p><h2 id=\"methods-of-organization\">Methods of organization</h2><p>In general, anyone working with software development is quite used to the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile-development?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">agile development method</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Agile</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Scrum</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban?WT.mc_id=blog-devtfcco-ludossan\">Kanban,</a> and other famous methodologies. And these Agile methods can also make your life very, well... agile.</p><p>That is why, many times, personal organization \"borrows\" productivity techniques from these methods that were created to help people accomplish a lot in a brief time. The most successful methods, I think, are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Scrum</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Kanban</a></li></ul><p>However, over time, people began to take Agile methods, which were originally created for complete teams, and turn them into individual methodologies for managing and fulfilling tasks. Hence other methodologies emerged, the best known being <a href=\"https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/work-smarter-not-harder-getting-things-done/?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">GTD (<em>Get Things Done</em>)</a>.</p><p>In addition, several techniques such as using a <a href=\"https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique\">Pomodoro</a> clock have been developed and can be combined with methodologies to obtain an even more effective result.</p><p>Let's talk a little about each one and how they can be applied.</p><h3 id=\"scrum-in-personal-organization\">Scrum in personal organization</h3><p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Scrum</a> is an agile continuous feedback methodology. In it, a Product Owner, a Scrum Master and a development team perform evolutionary iterations about a product so that it is developed together with the client's participation in each process. This is unlike the older <em>waterfall</em> model that was based on a step to step process.</p><p>The team is organized into sprints, which can last 7, 14 or more days. In these sprints all tasks to be performed within that <em>timeframe</em> are already described and nothing else can be changed until the next sprint. </p><p>Every day the team holds a 15-minute <em>daily standup</em> and at the end of the sprint the team performs a review and a retrospective.</p><p>Of course we have no way to incorporate team meetings into our personal organization methodology unless you have a talent for discussing things with yourself. But the sprint model is widely used (with some facilitations) to help us further improve the way we can organize our time. </p><p>Below are some points that we can think about when developing our methodology:</p><ul><li>Use 7-day sprints. Meaning, plan your entire week on Sunday</li><li>Use sprint points (which we talked about in the previous paragraphs) to measure the number of tasks you do per sprint. This way you will know when you exceed your limit.</li><li>Remember: <strong>Unforeseen events happen</strong>, so relax the rule of not changing anything in the sprint so that it allows additions and removals during the week.</li><li>Optionally at the end of the sprint do a retrospective checking what you did well or not that week so that you don't repeat the mistake the following week.</li></ul><h3 id=\"kanban-in-personal-organization\">Kanban in personal organization</h3><p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\">Kanban</a> is another interesting model that is often mixed with Scrum. In this model, visualization is the key, so we have the so-called <em>Kanban Boards</em>, as follows:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/_img/kanban-board-testing-1.png?WT.mc_id=blog-fcc-ludossan\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"kanban-board-testing-1.png?WT\" width=\"1614\" height=\"530\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The entire Kanban methodology is based on flow control. So instead of having someone telling you what to do, people put their needs in a backlog and the team will take and perform the tasks as there are slots available. </p><p>This is because, in Kanban, we have a limit of work that can be done at a time, and usually one person cannot do more than two tasks at the same time.</p><p>That is why the board is necessary. Having a view of what is blocked, what is being done, and what needs to be done gives interesting insights for those who are managing the project.</p><p>Again, if it's just you, you're not working on a team, so some parts of the methodology, like having someone producing and asking for tasks that are added to the backlog, must be done manually. So here are some other tips:</p><ul><li>Use a board to organize your tasks</li><li>List everything that needs to be done and add the tasks as they arrive</li><li>Reprioritize the backlog whenever a new task is added to it</li><li>Use work limitation to focus</li></ul><h1 id=\"gtd\">GTD</h1><p>The GTD (Get Things Done) was created by David Allen, an American who dedicated his work to discovering how to be more productive. In my opinion, GTD combined with other methods can be an extremely effective way of making things, in fact, happen.</p><p>The GTD is divided into a few steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Capture</strong>: Get the task or action that needs to be done and write it down in a more reliable way, as we talked about in the previous paragraphs.</li><li><strong>Clarify</strong>: The time you take to define and describe all tasks.</li><li><strong>Organize</strong>: Keep the list always organized and easily accessible</li><li><strong>Reflect</strong>: Review of tasks and setting priorities</li><li><strong>Engage</strong>: Get to work</li></ol><p>You don't have to follow all the steps to the letter. I, for example, do not have a moment in my day when I clarify all tasks, because I will never remember everything. So, I capture and clarify at the same time. Organization and reflection are also done the moment I add a task to the list (something I borrowed from Kanban).</p><p>The entire methodology is well explained with the following diagram:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2430/1*wStFYE_kkPXV94AVG6p_Og.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*wStFYE_kkPXV94AVG6p_Og\" width=\"1215\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>GTD in one diagram</figcaption></figure><p>We are constantly receiving input from the environment, both new tasks and everyday items. As soon as we receive one of these inputs we have to think: \"Is there anything I can do with this?\", If the answer is \"no\", then you have three options:</p><ul><li><strong>Throw Away</strong>: You will never use this (a spam email or something like that)</li><li><strong>Reminder</strong>: You will probably use this at some point and already know the date. So, you can defer this task to when you believe you will be using it</li><li><strong>Reference</strong>: If you believe that this item will be reference material (a document, certificate), store it in a very well-organized place so that you can find it super-fast.</li></ul><p>If you have an action that can be performed on the task, let's go back to the previous article, where we can perform three types of actions on that task:</p><ul><li><strong>If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it!</strong></li><li><strong>Delegate</strong>: And, as soon as you delegate, create another follow-up task for a future date</li><li><strong>Postpone</strong>: When we don't need to take immediate action, but we know that we will need it in the future</li></ul><p>See that we are applying the <em>inbox zero</em> techniques that we saw in the beginning with the techniques of this methodology. That is, we are adapting the techniques of each one so that they work better as a whole.</p><p>Another interesting concept of GTD is that of \"projects\". Any task that requires more than one step to complete is called a project. These projects are groups of tasks that need to have all the necessary information at hand.</p><h1 id=\"pomodoro\">Pomodoro</h1><p>Finally, we are not going to talk about a methodology, but a technique. <a href=\"https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique\">Pomodoro</a> was created by Francesco Cirilo in the 80s.</p><p>This is a somewhat radical technique: it requires that you will have to do your tasks in timeframes of 25 minutes each. That is, for each task you need to be completely free of distractions for 25 minutes, at least. This timeframe is called a <em>pomodoro</em>.</p><p>After a pomodoro, you take a five minute break. And after four pomodoros, a 30-minute break. This technique can be combined with any of the previous methodologies to complete your productivity, since it avoids procrastination.</p><p>Whenever you finish a task, write down how many pomodoros you took and cross it off the list. This, over time, helps to understand how long it takes you to complete your tasks.</p><p>However, like any methodology, it has pros and cons. One of the biggest cons is that if you are in a \"flow\" state, where everything is flowing and you are producing continuously, the timer can end right in the middle of your productivity. Then it can take you longer to get back to where you were or even completely lose the idea. </p><p>In these cases, the ideal is to adjust the time of a pomodoro to a longer span, so that you can concentrate without any interruption.</p><h1 id=\"habits\">Habits</h1><p>As has been made clear since the beginning of this article, habits are very important. There is no point in having the best organizational methodology but not having the habit of looking at lists.</p><p>A habit takes about 21 days to create, and cannot be removed, just replaced by another habit. So, to create habits we can use our own willpower and force ourselves to do the same things that we want to keep, for 21 days in a row, without interruptions. But this is very difficult for everyone, so we can all use a little help.</p><p>There are several tools that can help us with creating habits, one of which is <a href=\"https://habitica.com/static/home\">Habitica</a>, which turns your life into an RPG adventure.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZgvkFic.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZgvkFic\" width=\"992\" height=\"326\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>It also has a board that allows you to define your habits, your tasks, and also what you want to do daily:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mhyt8Aq.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"mhyt8Aq\" width=\"2654\" height=\"1072\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h1 id=\"create-your-own-methodology\">Create your own methodology</h1><p>In the end, it will all come down to creating your own way of working. Do not worry about strictly following the ideas of all methodologies because that will not work. The ideal is that you adapt each one of them and look for parts that make you organize better and feel good as you apply your own methodology.</p><p>In my case, I try to follow the GTD methodology. So whenever I'm working on something very important, I turn off all electronic devices and focus until I finish the task. It's more or less like the pomodoro, but without the timer – because I've used that technique and I didn't adapt very well to the breaks.</p><p>Whenever I have a new task or a new email, I go through the process described by the infographic, but I don't have an \"incubator\" for tasks. I can simply do it or not do it, and tasks that are not done end up going in the waste bin.</p><p>In addition, all my tasks have a time and date set – I never put a task in \"as soon as possible\". If the task is urgent, it must be done right after this task or right now.</p><p>To organize myself, I usually make constant revisions to my calendar to adjust to any changes and I am always working to improve it. This hasn't been very productive lately, so I'm going to make a change so that I can apply a quantitative assessment (like sprint points) weekly and review it every Sunday, which is when I plan the next sprint.</p><p>I don't like the \"projects\" in the GTD because it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. So, in Todoist, I end up using projects as categories to define what kind of work I'm dedicated to, such as: Studies, Personal, Articles, and so on.</p><p>Finally, I like to keep the idea of ​​Kanban, so I organize all the tasks in a single \"inbox\" that would be my backlog. After that, I search and take the tasks one by one and organize them all into categories until there is no new task in the box. </p><p>Besides, I don't plan a single week at a time. I try to organize the tasks so that they fill up at least two to three weeks. I always fill in a concise description and an expressive title that help me to remember what I need to do every moment.</p><h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>There is no best methodology, because the best one is the one that suits you. Try to mix a little of each one to create what works best, and don't be afraid to test and make mistakes.
