consumed many API's over the past few years. During that time, I've come across good and bad practices and have experienced nasty situations when consuming and building API's. But there also have been great moments.</p><p>There are helpful articles online which present many best practices, but many of them lack some practicality in my opinion. Knowing the theory with few examples is good, but I've always wondered how the implementation would look in a more real world example.</p><p>Providing simple examples helps to understand the concept itself without a lot of complexity, but in practice things aren't always so simple. I'm pretty sure you know what I'm talking about 😁</p><p>That's why I've decided to write this tutorial. I've merged all those learnings (good and bad) together into one digestible article while providing a practical example that can be followed along. In the end, we'll build a full API while we're implementing one best practice after another.</p><p>A few things to remember before we start off:</p><p>Best practices are, as you might have guessed, not specific laws or rules to follow. They are conventions or tips that have evolved over time and turned out to be effective. Some have became standard nowadays. But this doesn't mean you have to adapt them 1:1.</p><p>They should give you a direction to make your API's better in terms of user experience (for the consumer and the builder), security, and performance. </p><p>Just keep in mind that projects are different and require different approaches. There might be situations where you can't or shouldn't follow a certain convention. So every engineer has to decide this for themselves or with their.</p><p>Now that we've got those things out of our way, without further ado let's get to work!</p><h2 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>\n<li><a href=\"#our-example-project\">Our Example Project</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#prerequisites\">Prerequisites</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#architecture\">Architecture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#basic-setup\">Basic Setup</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#rest-api-best-practices\">REST API Best Practices</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#versioning\">Versioning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#name-resources-in-plural\">Name resources in plural</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#accept-and-respond-with-data-in-json-format\">Accept and respond with data in JSON format</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#respond-with-standard-http-error-codes\">Respond with standard HTTP Error Codes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#avoid-verbs-in-endpoint-names\">Avoid verbs in endpoint names</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#group-associated-resources-together-logical-nesting-\">Group associated resources together</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integrate-filtering-sorting-pagination\">Integrate filtering, sorting &amp; pagination</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#use-data-caching-for-performance-improvements\">Use data caching for performance improvements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#good-security-practices\">Good security practices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#document-your-api-properly\">Document your API properly</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id=\"our-example-project\">Our Example Project</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash--1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash--1-\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash--1-.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash--1-.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/04/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash--1-.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/alvaro-reyes-qWwpHwip31M-unsplash--1-.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@alvarordesign?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Alvaro Reyes</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/project?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Before we start implementing the best practices into our example project, I'd like to give you a brief introduction to what we'll be building.</p><p>We'll build a REST API for a CrossFit Training Application. If you're not familiar with CrossFit, it's a fitness method and competitive sport that combines high-intensity workouts with elements from several sports (olympic weightlifting, gymnastics, and others).</p><p>In our application we'd like to create, read, update and delete <strong>WOD</strong>'s (<strong>W</strong>orkouts <strong>o</strong>f the <strong>D</strong>ay). This will help our users (that will be gym owners) come up with workout plans and maintain their own workouts inside a single application. On top of that, they also can add some important training tips for each workout.</p><p>Our job will require us to design and implement an API for that application.</p><h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3><p>In order to follow along you need to have some experience in JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js and in Backend Architecture. Terms like REST and API shouldn't be new to you and you should have an understanding of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model\">Client-Server-Model</a>.</p><p>Of course you don't have to be an expert in those topics, but familiarity and ideally some experience should be enough.</p><p>If not all prerequisites apply to you, it's of course not a reason to skip this tutorial. There's still a lot to learn here for you as well. But having those skills will make it easier for you to follow along.</p><p>Even though this API is written in JavaScript and Express, the best practices are not limited to these tools. They can be applied to other programming languages or frameworks as well.</p><h3 id=\"architecture\">Architecture</h3><p>As discussed above, we'll be using Express.js for our API. I don't want to come up with a complex architecture so I'd like to stick to the<strong> 3 Layer Architecture:</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-25-um-14.33.24-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-25-um-14.33.24-1\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-25-um-14.33.24-1.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-25-um-14.33.24-1.png 937w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"937\" height=\"1039\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Inside the <strong>Controller</strong> we'll be handling all stuff that is related to HTTP. That means we're dealing with requests and responses for our endpoints. Above that layer is also a little <strong>Router</strong> from Express that passes requests to the corresponding controller.</p><p>The whole business logic will be in the<strong> Service Layer</strong> that exports certain services (methods) which are used by the controller.</p><p>The third layer is the <strong>Data Access Layer</strong> where we'll be working with our Database. We'll be exporting some methods for certain database operations like creating a WOD that can be used by our Service Layer.</p><p>In our example we're not using a <em>real</em> database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL because I'd like to focus more on the best practices itself. Therefore we're using a local JSON file that mimics our Database. But this logic can be transferred to other databases of course.</p><h3 id=\"basic-setup\">Basic Setup</h3><p>Now we should be ready to create a basic setup for our API. We won't overcomplicate things, and we'll build a simple but organized project structure.</p><p>First, let's create the overall folder structure with all necessary files and dependencies. After that, we'll make a quick test to check if everything is running properly:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create project folder &amp; navigate into it\nmkdir crossfit-wod-api &amp;&amp; cd crossfit-wod-api</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create a src folder &amp; navigate into it\nmkdir src &amp;&amp; cd src</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create sub folders\nmkdir controllers &amp;&amp; mkdir services &amp;&amp; mkdir database &amp;&amp; mkdir routes</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create an index file (entry point of our API)\ntouch index.js</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># We're currently in the src folder, so we need to move one level up first \ncd .. \n\n# Create package.json file \nnpm init -y</code></pre><p>Install dependencies for the basic setup:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Dev Dependencies \nnpm i -D nodemon \n\n# Dependencies \nnpm i express</code></pre><p>Open the project up in your favorite Text Editor and configure Express:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/index.js \nconst express = require(\"express\"); \n\nconst app = express(); \nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; \n\n// For testing purposes \napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; { \n    res.send(\"&lt;h2&gt;It's Working!&lt;/h2&gt;\"); \n}); \n\napp.listen(PORT, () =&gt; { \n    console.log(`API is listening on port ${PORT}`); \n});</code></pre><p>Integrate a new script called <strong>\"dev\"</strong> inside package.json:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"name\": \"crossfit-wod-api\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"nodemon src/index.js\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"nodemon\": \"^2.0.15\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.17.3\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The script makes sure that the development server restarts automatically when we make changes (thanks to nodemon).</p><p>Spin up the development server:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm run dev</code></pre><p>Look at your terminal, and there should be a message that the <strong>\"API is listening on port 3000\"</strong>.</p><p>Visit <strong>localhost:3000</strong> inside your browser.

Now that we have a really basic Express setup, we can extend our API with the following best practices.</p><p>Let's start simple with our fundamental CRUD endpoints. After that we'll be extending the API with each best practice.</p><h3 id=\"versioning\">Versioning</h3><p>Wait a second. Before we write any API-specific code we should be aware of versioning. Like in other applications there will be improvements, new features, and stuff like that. So it's important to version our API as well.</p><p>The big advantage is that we can work on new features or improvements on a new version while the clients are still using the current version and are not affected by breaking changes.</p><p>We also don't force the clients to use the new version straight away. They can use the current version and migrate on their own when the new version is stable.</p><p>The current and new versions are basically running in parallel and don't affect each other.</p><p>But how can we differentiate between the versions? One good practice is to add a path segment like <strong>v1</strong> or <strong>v2 </strong>into the URL.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Version 1 \n\"/api/v1/workouts\" \n\n// Version 2 \n\"/api/v2/workouts\" \n\n// ...</code></pre><p>That's what we expose to the outside world and what can be consumed by other developers. But we also need to structure our project in order to differentiate between each version.</p><p>There are many different approaches to handling versioning inside an Express API. In our case I'd like to create a sub folder for each version inside our <strong>src</strong> directory called <strong>v1</strong>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir src/v1</code></pre><p>Now we move our routes folder into that new v1 directory.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Get the path to your current directory (copy it) \npwd \n\n# Move \"routes\" into \"v1\" (insert the path from above into {pwd}) \nmv {pwd}/src/routes {pwd}/src/v1</code></pre><p>The new directory <strong>/src/v1/routes </strong>will store all our routes for version 1. We will add \"real\" content later on. But for now let's add a simple <strong>index.js </strong>file to test things out.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># In /src/v1/routes \ntouch index.js</code></pre><p>Inside there we spin up a simple router.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/routes/index.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.route(\"/\").get((req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(`&lt;h2&gt;Hello from ${req.baseUrl}&lt;/h2&gt;`);\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;</code></pre><p>Now we have to hook up our router for v1 inside our root entry point inside src/index.js.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/index.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst v1Router = require(\"./v1/routes\");\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// *** REMOVE ***\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"&lt;h2&gt;It's Working!&lt;/h2&gt;\");\n});\n\n// *** ADD ***\napp.use(\"/api/v1\", v1Router);\n\napp.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`API is listening on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n</code></pre><p>Now visit <strong>localhost:3000/api/v1</strong> inside your browser and you should see the following:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.22.28.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.22.28\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.22.28.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.22.28.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.22.28.png 1384w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1384\" height=\"678\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Congratulations! You've just structured the project for handling different versions. We are now passing incoming requests with \"/api/v1\" to our version 1 router, that will route each request to the corresponding controller method later.</p><p>Before we move on, I'd like to point something out.</p><p>We just moved our routes folder<strong> </strong>into our v1 directory. The other folders like controllers or services still remain inside our src directory. That is okay for now because we are building a rather small API. We can use the same controllers and services in each version globally.</p><p>When the API is growing and requires different controller methods specific for v2, for example, it would be a better idea to move the controllers folder into the v2 directory as well to have all specific logic for that particular version encapsulated.</p><p>Another reason for that could be that we might change a service that is used by all other versions. We don't want to break things in the other versions. So it would be a wise decision to move the services folder also into a specific version folder.</p><p>But as I said, in our example it's okay for me to only differentiate between the routes and let the router handle the rest. Nonetheless it's important to keep that in mind to have a clear structure when the API scales up and needs changes.</p><h3 id=\"name-resources-in-plural\">Name Resources in Plural</h3><p>After setting it all up we can now dive into the real implementation of our API. Like I said, I'd like to start with our fundamental CRUD endpoints.</p><p>In other words, let's start implementing endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting workouts.</p><p>First, let's hook up a specific controller, service, and router for our workouts.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">touch src/controllers/workoutController.js \n\ntouch src/services/workoutService.js \n\ntouch src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js</code></pre><p>I always like to start with the routes first. Let's think about how we can name our endpoints. This goes hand in hand with this particular best practice.</p><p>We could name the creation endpoint <strong>/api/v1/workout </strong>because we'd like to add one workout, right? Basically there's nothing wrong with that approach – but this can lead to misunderstandings.</p><p>Always remember: Your API is used by other humans and should be precise. This goes also for naming your resources.</p><p>I always imagine a resource like a box. In our example the box is a collection that stores different <strong>workouts</strong>.</p><p>Naming your resources in plural has the big advantage that it's crystal clear to other humans, that this is a collection that consists of different workouts.</p><p>So, let's define our endpoints inside our workout router.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Get all workouts\");\n});\n\nrouter.get(\"/:workoutId\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Get an existing workout\");\n});\n\nrouter.post(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Create a new workout\");\n});\n\nrouter.patch(\"/:workoutId\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Update an existing workout\");\n});\n\nrouter.delete(\"/:workoutId\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Delete an existing workout\");\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre><p>You can delete our test file <strong>index.js</strong> inside <strong>src/v1/routes</strong>.</p><p>Now let's jump into our entry point and hook up our v1 workout router.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/index.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n// *** REMOVE ***\nconst v1Router = require(\"./v1/routes\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst v1WorkoutRouter = require(\"./v1/routes/workoutRoutes\");\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// *** REMOVE ***\napp.use(\"/api/v1\", v1Router);\n\n// *** ADD ***\napp.use(\"/api/v1/workouts\", v1WorkoutRouter);\n\napp.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`API is listening on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n</code></pre><p>That went smoothly, right? Now we're catching all requests that are going to <strong>/api/v1/workouts</strong> with our v1WorkoutRouter.</p><p>Inside our router we will call a different method handled by our controller for each different endpoint.</p><p>Let's create a method for each endpoint. Just sending a message back should be fine for now.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\nconst getAllWorkouts = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Get all workouts\");\n};\n\nconst getOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Get an existing workout\");\n};\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Create a new workout\");\n};\n\nconst updateOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Update an existing workout\");\n};\n\nconst deleteOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Delete an existing workout\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllWorkouts,\n  getOneWorkout,\n  createNewWorkout,\n  updateOneWorkout,\n  deleteOneWorkout,\n};\n</code></pre><p>Now it's time to refactor our workout router a bit and use the controller methods.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst workoutController = require(\"../../controllers/workoutController\");\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get(\"/\", workoutController.getAllWorkouts);\n\nrouter.get(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.getOneWorkout);\n\nrouter.post(\"/\", workoutController.createNewWorkout);\n\nrouter.patch(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.updateOneWorkout);\n\nrouter.delete(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.deleteOneWorkout);\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre><p>Now we can test our <strong>GET /api/v1/workouts/:workoutId</strong> endpoint by typing <strong>localhost:3000/api/v1/workouts/2342</strong> inside the browser. You should see something like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.29.19.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.29.19\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.29.19.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.29.19.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.29.19.png 1373w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1373\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>We've made it! The first layer of our architecture is done. Let's create our service layer by implementing the next best practice.</p><h3 id=\"accept-and-respond-with-data-in-json-format\">Accept and respond with data in JSON format</h3><p>When interacting with an API, you always send specific data with your request or you receive data with the response. There are many different data formats but JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is a standardized format.</p><p>Although there's the term <strong>JavaScript</strong> in JSON, it's not tied to it specifically. You can also write your API with Java or Python that can handle JSON as well.</p><p>Because of its standardization, API's should accept and respond with data in JSON format.</p><p>Let's take a look at our current implementation and see how we can integrate this best practice.</p><p>First, we create our service layer.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/services/workoutService.js\nconst getAllWorkouts = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst getOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst createNewWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst updateOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst deleteOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllWorkouts,\n  getOneWorkout,\n  createNewWorkout,\n  updateOneWorkout,\n  deleteOneWorkout,\n};\n</code></pre><p>It's also a good practice to name the service methods the same as the controller methods so that you have a connection between those. Let's start off with just returning nothing.</p><p>Inside our workout controller we can use these methods.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\n// *** ADD ***\nconst workoutService = require(\"../services/workoutService\");\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const allWorkouts = workoutService.getAllWorkouts();\n  res.send(\"Get all workouts\");\n};\n\nconst getOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const workout = workoutService.getOneWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Get an existing workout\");\n};\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const createdWorkout = workoutService.createNewWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Create a new workout\");\n};\n\nconst updateOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const updatedWorkout = workoutService.updateOneWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Update an existing workout\");\n};\n\nconst deleteOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  workoutService.deleteOneWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Delete an existing workout\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllWorkouts,\n  getOneWorkout,\n  createNewWorkout,\n  updateOneWorkout,\n  deleteOneWorkout,\n};\n</code></pre><p>At the moment nothing should have changed inside our responses. But under the hood our controller layer talks now with our service layer.</p><p>Inside our service methods we'll be handling our business logic like transforming data structures and communicating with our Database Layer.</p><p>To do that, we need a database and a collection of methods that actually handle the database interaction. Our database will be a simple JSON file that is pre-filled with some workouts already.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create a new file called db.json inside src/database \ntouch src/database/db.json \n\n# Create a Workout File that stores all workout specific methods in /src/database \ntouch src/database/Workout.js</code></pre><p>Copy the following into db.json:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"workouts\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"61dbae02-c147-4e28-863c-db7bd402b2d6\",\n      \"name\": \"Tommy V\",\n      \"mode\": \"For Time\",\n      \"equipment\": [\n        \"barbell\",\n        \"rope\"\n      ],\n      \"exercises\": [\n        \"21 thrusters\",\n        \"12 rope climbs, 15 ft\",\n        \"15 thrusters\",\n        \"9 rope climbs, 15 ft\",\n        \"9 thrusters\",\n        \"6 rope climbs, 15 ft\"\n      ],\n      \"createdAt\": \"4/20/2022, 2:21:56 PM\",\n      \"updatedAt\": \"4/20/2022, 2:21:56 PM\",\n      \"trainerTips\": [\n        \"Split the 21 thrusters as needed\",\n        \"Try to do the 9 and 6 thrusters unbroken\",\n        \"RX Weights: 115lb/75lb\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"4a3d9aaa-608c-49a7-a004-66305ad4ab50\",\n      \"name\": \"Dead Push-Ups\",\n      \"mode\": \"AMRAP 10\",\n      \"equipment\": [\n        \"barbell\"\n      ],\n      \"exercises\": [\n        \"15 deadlifts\",\n        \"15 hand-release push-ups\"\n      ],\n      \"createdAt\": \"1/25/2022, 1:15:44 PM\",\n      \"updatedAt\": \"3/10/2022, 8:21:56 AM\",\n      \"trainerTips\": [\n        \"Deadlifts are meant to be light and fast\",\n        \"Try to aim for unbroken sets\",\n        \"RX Weights: 135lb/95lb\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"d8be2362-7b68-4ea4-a1f6-03f8bc4eede7\",\n      \"name\": \"Heavy DT\",\n      \"mode\": \"5 Rounds For Time\",\n      \"equipment\": [\n        \"barbell\",\n        \"rope\"\n      ],\n      \"exercises\": [\n        \"12 deadlifts\",\n        \"9 hang power cleans\",\n        \"6 push jerks\"\n      ],\n      \"createdAt\": \"11/20/2021, 5:39:07 PM\",\n      \"updatedAt\": \"11/20/2021, 5:39:07 PM\",\n      \"trainerTips\": [\n        \"Aim for unbroken push jerks\",\n        \"The first three rounds might feel terrible, but stick to it\",\n        \"RX Weights: 205lb/145lb\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}</code></pre><p>As you can see there are three workouts inserted. One workout consists of an id, name, mode, equipment, exercises, createdAt, updatedAt, and trainerTips.</p><p>Let's start with the simplest one and return all workouts that are stored and start with implementing the corresponding method inside our Data Access Layer (src/database/Workout.js).</p><p>Again, I've chosen to name the method inside here the same as the one in the service and the controller. But this it totally optional.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/database/Workout.js\nconst DB = require(\"./db.json\");\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = () =&gt; {\n  return DB.workouts;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = { getAllWorkouts };\n</code></pre><p>Jump right back into our workout service and implement the logic for <strong>getAllWorkouts.</strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/database/workoutService.js\n// *** ADD ***\nconst Workout = require(\"../database/Workout\");\nconst getAllWorkouts = () =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const allWorkouts = Workout.getAllWorkouts();\n  // *** ADD ***\n  return allWorkouts;\n};\n\nconst getOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst createNewWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst updateOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst deleteOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllWorkouts,\n  getOneWorkout,\n  createNewWorkout,\n  updateOneWorkout,\n  deleteOneWorkout,\n};\n</code></pre><p>Returning all workouts is pretty simple and we don't have to do transformations because it's already a JSON file. We also don't need to take in any arguments for now. So this implementation is pretty straightforward. But we'll come back to this later.</p><p>Back in our workout controller we receive the return value from <code>workoutService.getAllWorkouts()</code> and simply send it as a response to the client. We've looped the database response through our service to the controller.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutControllers.js\nconst workoutService = require(\"../services/workoutService\");\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const allWorkouts = workoutService.getAllWorkouts();\n  // *** ADD ***\n  res.send({ status: \"OK\", data: allWorkouts });\n};\n\nconst getOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const workout = workoutService.getOneWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Get an existing workout\");\n};\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const createdWorkout = workoutService.createNewWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Create a new workout\");\n};\n\nconst updateOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const updatedWorkout = workoutService.updateOneWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Update an existing workout\");\n};\n\nconst deleteOneWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  workoutService.deleteOneWorkout();\n  res.send(\"Delete an existing workout\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllWorkouts,\n  getOneWorkout,\n  createNewWorkout,\n  updateOneWorkout,\n  deleteOneWorkout,\n};\n</code></pre><p>Go to <strong>localhost:3000/api/v1/workouts</strong> inside your browser and you should see the response JSON.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.38.14.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.38.14\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.38.14.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.38.14.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.38.14.png 1366w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1366\" height=\"998\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>That went great! We're sending back data in JSON format. But what about accepting it? Let's think about an endpoint where we need to receive JSON data from the client. The endpoint for creating or updating a workout needs data from the client.</p><p>Inside our workout controller we extract the request body for creating a new workout and we pass it on to the workout service. Inside the workout service we'll insert it into our DB.json and send the newly created workout back to the client.</p><p>To be able to parse the sent JSON inside the request body, we need to install <strong>body-parser</strong> first and configure it.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm i body-parser</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/index.js \nconst express = require(\"express\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\nconst v1WorkoutRouter = require(\"./v1/routes/workoutRoutes\");\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// *** ADD ***\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(\"/api/v1/workouts\", v1WorkoutRouter);\n\napp.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`API is listening on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n</code></pre><p>Now we're able to receive the JSON data inside our controllers under <strong>req.body.</strong></p><p>In order to test it properly, just open your favorite HTTP client (I'm using Postman), create a POST request to localhost:3000/api/v1/workouts and a request body in JSON format like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{\n  \"name\": \"Core Buster\",\n  \"mode\": \"AMRAP 20\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    \"rack\",\n    \"barbell\",\n    \"abmat\"\n  ],\n  \"exercises\": [\n    \"15 toes to bars\",\n    \"10 thrusters\",\n    \"30 abmat sit-ups\"\n  ],\n  \"trainerTips\": [\n    \"Split your toes to bars into two sets maximum\",\n    \"Go unbroken on the thrusters\",\n    \"Take the abmat sit-ups as a chance to normalize your breath\"\n  ]\n}</code></pre><p>As you've might noticed, there are some properties missing like \"id\", \"createdAt\" and \"updatedAt\". That's the job of our API to add those properties before inserting it. We'll take care of it inside our workout service later.</p><p>Inside the method <strong>createNewWorkout</strong> in our workout controller, we can extract the body from the request object, do some validation, and pass it as an argument to our workout service.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\n...\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const { body } = req;\n  // *** ADD ***\n  if (\n    !body.name ||\n    !body.mode ||\n    !body.equipment ||\n    !body.exercises ||\n    !body.trainerTips\n  ) {\n    return;\n  }\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const newWorkout = {\n    name: body.name,\n    mode: body.mode,\n    equipment: body.equipment,\n    exercises: body.exercises,\n    trainerTips: body.trainerTips,\n  };\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const createdWorkout = workoutService.createNewWorkout(newWorkout);\n  // *** ADD ***\n  res.status(201).send({ status: \"OK\", data: createdWorkout });\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>To improve the request validation you normally would use a third party package like <a href=\"https://express-validator.github.io/docs/\">express-validator</a>.</p><p>Let's go into our workout service and receive the data inside our createNewWorkout method.</p><p>After that we add the missing properties to the object and pass it to a new method in our Data Access Layer to store it inside our DB.</p><p>First, we create a simple Util Function to overwrite our JSON file to persist the data.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create a utils file inside our database directory \ntouch src/database/utils.js</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/database/utils.js\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nconst saveToDatabase = (DB) =&gt; {\n  fs.writeFileSync(\"./src/database/db.json\", JSON.stringify(DB, null, 2), {\n    encoding: \"utf-8\",\n  });\n};\n\nmodule.exports = { saveToDatabase };\n</code></pre><p>Then we can use this function in our Workout.js file.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/database/Workout.js\nconst DB = require(\"./db.json\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst { saveToDatabase } = require(\"./utils\");\n\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = () =&gt; {\n  return DB.workouts;\n};\n\n// *** ADD ***\nconst createNewWorkout = (newWorkout) =&gt; {\n  const isAlreadyAdded =\n    DB.workouts.findIndex((workout) =&gt; workout.name === newWorkout.name) &gt; -1;\n  if (isAlreadyAdded) {\n    return;\n  }\n  DB.workouts.push(newWorkout);\n  saveToDatabase(DB);\n  return newWorkout;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllWorkouts,\n  // *** ADD ***\n  createNewWorkout,\n};\n</code></pre><p>That was smooth! The next step is to use the database methods inside our workout service.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Install the uuid package \nnpm i uuid</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/services/workoutService.js\n// *** ADD ***\nconst { v4: uuid } = require(\"uuid\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst Workout = require(\"../database/Workout\");\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = () =&gt; {\n    const allWorkouts = Workout.getAllWorkouts();\n    return allWorkouts;\n};\n\nconst getOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (newWorkout) =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const workoutToInsert = {\n    ...newWorkout,\n    id: uuid(),\n    createdAt: new Date().toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { timeZone: \"UTC\" }),\n    updatedAt: new Date().toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { timeZone: \"UTC\" }),\n  };\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const createdWorkout = Workout.createNewWorkout(workoutToInsert);\n  return createdWorkout;\n};\n\nconst updateOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nconst deleteOneWorkout = () =&gt; {\n  return;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllWorkouts,\n  getOneWorkout,\n  createNewWorkout,\n  updateOneWorkout,\n  deleteOneWorkout,\n};\n</code></pre><p>Wow! This was fun, right? Now you can go to your HTTP client, send the POST request again, and you should receive the newly created workout as JSON.</p><p>If you try to add the same workout for a second time, you still receive a 201 status code, but without the newly inserted workout. </p><p>This means that our database method cancels the insertion for now and is just returning nothing. That's because our if-statement to check if there is already a workout inserted with the same name kicks in. That's good for now, we'll handle that case in the next best practice!</p><p>Now, send a GET request to <strong>localhost:3000/api/v1/workouts</strong> to read all workouts. I'm choosing the browser for that. You should see that our workout got successfully inserted and persisted:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.57.23.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.57.23\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.57.23.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.57.23.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-11.57.23.png 1420w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1420\" height=\"690\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>You can implement the other methods by yourself or just copy my implementations.</p><p>First, the workout controller (you can just copy the whole content):</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\nconst workoutService = require(\"../services/workoutService\");\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = (req, res) =&gt;

Let's move on to the next best practice and see how we can handle errors properly.</p><h3 id=\"respond-with-standard-http-error-codes\">Respond with standard HTTP Error Codes</h3><p>We've already came pretty far, but we're not finished yet. Our API has the ability now to handle basic CRUD operations with data storage. That's great, but not really ideal.</p><p>Why? Let me explain.</p><p>In a perfect world everything works smoothly without any errors. But as you might know, in the real world a lot of errors can happen –&nbsp;either from a human or a technical perspective.</p><p>You might probably know that weird feeling when things are working right from the beginning without any errors. This is great and enjoyable, but as developers we're more used to things that are not working properly. 😁</p><p>The same goes for our API. We should handle certain cases that might go wrong or throw an error. This will also harden our API.</p><p>When something goes wrong (either from the request or inside our API) we send HTTP Error codes back. I've seen and used API's that were returning all the time a 400 error code when a request was buggy without any specific message about WHY this error occurred or what the mistake was. So debugging became a pain.</p><p>That's the reason why it's always a good practice to return proper HTTP error codes for different cases. This helps the consumer or the engineer who built the API to identify the problem more easily.</p><p>To improve the experience we also can send a quick error message along with the error response. But as I've written in the introduction this isn't always very wise and should be considered by the engineer themself.</p><p>For example, returning something like <strong>\"The username is already signed up\"</strong> should be well thought out because you're providing information about your users that you should really hide.</p><p>In our Crossfit API we will take a look at the creation endpoint and see what errors might arise and how we can handle them. At the end of this tip you'll find again the complete implementation for the other endpoints.</p><p>Let's start looking at our createNewWorkout method inside our workout controller:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\n...\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const { body } = req;\n  if (\n    !body.name ||\n    !body.mode ||\n    !body.equipment ||\n    !body.exercises ||\n    !body.trainerTips\n  ) {\n    return;\n  }\n  const newWorkout = {\n    name: body.name,\n    mode: body.mode,\n    equipment: body.equipment,\n    exercises: body.exercises,\n    trainerTips: body.trainerTips,\n  };\n  const createdWorkout = workoutService.createNewWorkout(newWorkout);\n  res.status(201).send({ status: \"OK\", data: createdWorkout });\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>We already caught the case that the request body is not built up properly and got missing keys that we expect.</p><p>This would be a good example to send back a 400 HTTP error with a corresponding error message.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\n...\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const { body } = req;\n  if (\n    !body.name ||\n    !body.mode ||\n    !body.equipment ||\n    !body.exercises ||\n    !body.trainerTips\n  ) {\n    res\n      .status(400)\n      .send({\n        status: \"FAILED\",\n        data: {\n          error:\n            \"One of the following keys is missing or is empty in request body: 'name', 'mode', 'equipment', 'exercises', 'trainerTips'\",\n        },\n      });\n    return;\n  }\n  const newWorkout = {\n    name: body.name,\n    mode: body.mode,\n    equipment: body.equipment,\n    exercises: body.exercises,\n    trainerTips: body.trainerTips,\n  };\n  const createdWorkout = workoutService.createNewWorkout(newWorkout);\n  res.status(201).send({ status: \"OK\", data: createdWorkout });\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>If we try to add a new workout but forget to provide the \"mode\" property in our request body, we should see the error message along with the 400 HTTP error code.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.17.21.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.17.21\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.17.21.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.17.21.png 998w\" width=\"998\" height=\"229\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>A developer who is consuming the API is now better informed about what to look for. They immediately know to go inside the request body and see if they've missed providing one of the required properties.</p><p>Leaving this error message more generic for all properties will be okay for now. Typically you'd use a schema validator for handling that.</p><p>Let's go one layer deeper into our workout service and see what potential errors might occur.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/services/workoutService.js\n...\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (newWorkout) =&gt; {\n  const workoutToInsert = {\n    ...newWorkout,\n    id: uuid(),\n    createdAt: new Date().toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { timeZone: \"UTC\" }),\n    updatedAt: new Date().toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { timeZone: \"UTC\" }),\n  };\n  const createdWorkout = Workout.createNewWorkout(workoutToInsert);\n  return createdWorkout;\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>One thing that might go wrong is the database insertion <strong>Workout.createNewWorkout(). </strong>I like to wrap this thing in a try/catch block to catch the error when it occurs.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/services/workoutService.js\n...\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (newWorkout) =&gt; {\n  const workoutToInsert = {\n    ...newWorkout,\n    id: uuid(),\n    createdAt: new Date().toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { timeZone: \"UTC\" }),\n    updatedAt: new Date().toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { timeZone: \"UTC\" }),\n  };\n  try {\n    const createdWorkout = Workout.createNewWorkout(workoutToInsert);\n    return createdWorkout;\n  } catch (error) {\n    throw error;\n  }\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>Every error that gets thrown inside our Workout.createNewWorkout() method will be caught inside our catch block. We're just throwing it back, so we can adjust our responses later inside our controller.</p><p>Let's define our errors in Workout.js:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/database/Workout.js\n...\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (newWorkout) =&gt; {\n  const isAlreadyAdded =\n    DB.workouts.findIndex((workout) =&gt; workout.name === newWorkout.name) &gt; -1;\n  if (isAlreadyAdded) {\n    throw {\n      status: 400,\n      message: `Workout with the name '${newWorkout.name}' already exists`,\n    };\n  }\n  try {\n    DB.workouts.push(newWorkout);\n    saveToDatabase(DB);\n    return newWorkout;\n  } catch (error) {\n    throw { status: 500, message: error?.message || error };\n  }\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>As you can see, an error consists of two things, a status and a message. I'm using just the <strong>throw</strong> keyword here to send out a different data structure than a string, which is required in <strong>throw new Error()</strong>. </p><p>A little downside of just throwing is that we don't get a stack trace. But normally this error throwing would be handled by a third party library of our choice (for example Mongoose if you use a MongoDB database). But for the purposes of this tutorial this should be fine.</p><p>Now we're able to throw and catch errors in the service and data access layer. We can move into our workout controller now, catch the errors there as well, and respond accordingly.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\n...\n\nconst createNewWorkout = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const { body } = req;\n  if (\n    !body.name ||\n    !body.mode ||\n    !body.equipment ||\n    !body.exercises ||\n    !body.trainerTips\n  ) {\n    res\n      .status(400)\n      .send({\n        status: \"FAILED\",\n        data: {\n          error:\n            \"One of the following keys is missing or is empty in request body: 'name', 'mode', 'equipment', 'exercises', 'trainerTips'\",\n        },\n      });\n    return;\n  }\n  const newWorkout = {\n    name: body.name,\n    mode: body.mode,\n    equipment: body.equipment,\n    exercises: body.exercises,\n    trainerTips: body.trainerTips,\n  };\n  // *** ADD ***\n  try {\n    const createdWorkout = workoutService.createNewWorkout(newWorkout);\n    res.status(201).send({ status: \"OK\", data: createdWorkout });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res\n      .status(error?.status || 500)\n      .send({ status: \"FAILED\", data: { error: error?.message || error } });\n  }\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>You can test things out by adding a workout with the same name twice or not providing a required property inside your request body. You should receive the corresponding HTTP error codes along with the error message.</p><p>To wrap this up and move to the next tip, you can copy the other implemented methods into the following files or you can try it on your own:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\nconst workoutService = require(\"../services/workoutService\");\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = (req, res) =&gt;

about our implementation. </p><p>We've got a resource called \"workouts\" on the one side and another called \"records\" on the other side. </p><p>To move on in our architecture it would be advisable to create another controller, another service, and another collection of database methods that are responsible for records. </p><p>Chances are high that have we to implement CRUD endpoints for the records as well, because records should be added, updated or deleted in the future as well. But this won't be the primary task for now.</p><p>We'll also need a record router to catch the specific requests for the records, but we don't need it right now. This could be a great chance for you to implement the CRUD operations for the records with their own routes and train a bit.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create records controller \ntouch src/controllers/recordController.js \n\n# Create records service \ntouch src/services/recordService.js \n\n# Create records database methods \ntouch src/database/Record.js</code></pre><p>That was easy.

We filter all the records that are related to the workout id out of the query parameter.</p><p>The next one is our record service:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/services/recordService.js\nconst Record = require(\"../database/Record\");\n\nconst getRecordForWorkout = (workoutId) =&gt; {\n  try {\n    const record = Record.getRecordForWorkout(workoutId);\n    return record;\n  } catch (error) {\n    throw error;\n  }\n};\nmodule.exports = { getRecordForWorkout };\n</code></pre><p>Again, nothing new here.</p><p>Now we're able to create a new route in our workout router and direct the request to our record service.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst workoutController = require(\"../../controllers/workoutController\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst recordController = require(\"../../controllers/recordController\");\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get(\"/\", workoutController.getAllWorkouts);\n\nrouter.get(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.getOneWorkout);\n\n// *** ADD ***\nrouter.get(\"/:workoutId/records\", recordController.getRecordForWorkout);\n\nrouter.post(\"/\", workoutController.createNewWorkout);\n\nrouter.patch(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.updateOneWorkout);\n\nrouter.delete(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.deleteOneWorkout);\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre><p>Great!

I'll show you a little example.</p><p>Imagine the frontend also needs an endpoint to get information about which member exactly holds the current record and wants to receive metadata about them.</p><p>Of course we could implement the following URI:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">GET /api/v1/workouts/:workoutId/records/members/:memberId</code></pre><p>The endpoint now becomes less manageable the more nesting we add to it. Therefore it's a good practice to store the URI to receive information about a member directly into the record.</p><p>Consider the following inside the database:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"workouts\": [ ...\n  ],\n  \"members\": [ ...\n  ],\n  \"records\": [ ... {\n      \"id\": \"ad75d475-ac57-44f4-a02a-8f6def58ff56\",\n      \"workout\": \"4a3d9aaa-608c-49a7-a004-66305ad4ab50\",\n      \"record\": \"160 reps\",\n      \"memberId\": \"11817fb1-03a1-4b4a-8d27-854ac893cf41\",\n      \"member\": \"/members/:memberId\"\n    },\n  ]\n}</code></pre><p>As you can see, we've added the two properties \"memberId\" and \"member\" to our records inside the database. This has the huge advantage that we don't have to nest deeper our existing endpoint.</p><p>The frontend just needs to call <strong> GET /api/v1/workouts/:workoutId/records </strong>and receives automatically all records that are connected with this workout. </p><p>On top of that it gets the member id and the endpoint to fetch information about that member. So, we avoided the deeper nesting of our endpoint.</p><p>Of course, this only works if we can handle requests to \"/members/:memberId\" 😁 This sounds like a great training opportunity for you to implement this situation!</p><h3 id=\"integrate-filtering-sorting-pagination\">Integrate filtering, sorting &amp; pagination</h3><p>Right now we're able to do quite a few operations with our API. That's great progress, but there's more.</p><p>During the last sections we focused on improving our developer experience and how our API can be interacted with. But the overall performance of our API is another key factor we should work on.</p><p>That's why integrating filtering, sorting, and pagination is also an essential factor on my list.</p><p>Imagine we've got 2,000 workouts, 450 records, and 500 members stored in our DB. When calling our endpoint to get all workouts we don't want to send all 2,000 workouts at once. This will be a very slow response of course, or it'll bring our systems down (maybe with 200,000 😁).</p><p>That's the reason why filtering and pagination are important. Filtering, as the name already says, is useful because it allows us to get specific data out of our whole collection. For example all workouts that have the mode \"For Time\".</p><p>Pagination is another mechanism to split our whole collection of workouts into multiple \"pages\" where each page only consists of twenty workouts, for example. This technique helps us to make sure that we don't send more than twenty workouts at the same time with our response to the client.</p><p>Sorting can be a complex task. So it's more effective to do it in our API and to send the sorted data to the client.</p><p>Let's start with integrating some filtering mechanism into our API. We will upgrade our endpoint that sends all workouts by accepting filter parameters. Normally in a GET request we add the filter criteria as a query parameter.</p><p>Our new URI will look like this, when we'd like to get only the workouts that are in the mode of \"AMRAP\" (<strong>A</strong>s <strong>M</strong>any <strong>R</strong>ounds <strong>A</strong>s <strong>P</strong>ossible): <strong>/api/v1/workouts?mode=amrap.</strong></p><p>To make this more fun we need to add some more workouts. Paste these workouts into your \"workouts\" collection inside db.json:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"name\": \"Jumping (Not) Made Easy\",\n  \"mode\": \"AMRAP 12\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    \"jump rope\"\n  ],\n  \"exercises\": [\n    \"10 burpees\",\n    \"25 double-unders\"\n  ],\n  \"trainerTips\": [\n    \"Scale to do 50 single-unders, if double-unders are too difficult\"\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"8f8318f8-b869-4e9d-bb78-88010193563a\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"4/25/2022, 2:45:28 PM\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"4/25/2022, 2:45:28 PM\"\n},\n{\n  \"name\": \"Burpee Meters\",\n  \"mode\": \"3 Rounds For Time\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    \"Row Erg\"\n  ],\n  \"exercises\": [\n    \"Row 500 meters\",\n    \"21 burpees\",\n    \"Run 400 meters\",\n    \"Rest 3 minutes\"\n  ],\n  \"trainerTips\": [\n    \"Go hard\",\n    \"Note your time after the first run\",\n    \"Try to hold your pace\"\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"0a5948af-5185-4266-8c4b-818889657e9d\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"4/25/2022, 2:48:53 PM\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"4/25/2022, 2:48:53 PM\"\n},\n{\n  \"name\": \"Dumbbell Rower\",\n  \"mode\": \"AMRAP 15\",\n  \"equipment\": [\n    \"Dumbbell\"\n  ],\n  \"exercises\": [\n    \"15 dumbbell rows, left arm\",\n    \"15 dumbbell rows, right arm\",\n    \"50-ft handstand walk\"\n  ],\n  \"trainerTips\": [\n    \"RX weights for women: 35-lb\",\n    \"RX weights for men: 50-lb\"\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"3dc53bc8-27b8-4773-b85d-89f0a354d437\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"4/25/2022, 2:56:03 PM\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"4/25/2022, 2:56:03 PM\"\n}</code></pre><p>After that we have to accept and handle query parameters. Our workout controller will be the right place to start:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/controllers/workoutController.js\n...\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  // *** ADD ***\n  const { mode } = req.query;\n  try {\n    // *** ADD ***\n    const allWorkouts = workoutService.getAllWorkouts({ mode });\n    res.send({ status: \"OK\", data: allWorkouts });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res\n      .status(error?.status || 500)\n      .send({ status: \"FAILED\", data: { error: error?.message || error } });\n  }\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>We're extracting \"mode\" from the req.query object and defining a parameter of workoutService.getAllWorkouts. This will be an object that consists of our filter parameters. </p><p>I'm using the shorthand syntax here, to create a new key called \"mode\" inside the object with the value of whatever is in \"req.query.mode\". This could be either a truthy value or undefined if there isn't a query parameter called \"mode\". We can extend this object the more filter parameters we'd like to accept.</p><p>In our workout service, pass it to your database method:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/services/workoutService.js\n...\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = (filterParams) =&gt; {\n  try {\n    // *** ADD ***\n    const allWorkouts = Workout.getAllWorkouts(filterParams);\n    return allWorkouts;\n  } catch (error) {\n    throw error;\n  }\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>Now we can use it in our database method and apply the filtering:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/database/Workout.js\n...\n\nconst getAllWorkouts = (filterParams) =&gt; {\n  try {\n    let workouts = DB.workouts;\n    if (filterParams.mode) {\n      return DB.workouts.filter((workout) =&gt;\n        workout.mode.toLowerCase().includes(filterParams.mode)\n      );\n    }\n    // Other if-statements will go here for different parameters\n    return workouts;\n  } catch (error) {\n    throw { status: 500, message: error };\n  }\n};\n\n...</code></pre><p>Pretty straightforward, right? All we do here is check if we actually have a truthy value for the key \"mode\" inside our \"filterParams\". If this is true, we filter all those workouts that have got the same \"mode\". If this is not true, then there is no query parameter called \"mode\" and we return all workouts because we don't need to filter.</p><p>We defined \"workouts\" here as a \"let\" variable because when adding more if-statements for different filters we can overwrite \"workouts\" and chain the filters.</p><p>Inside your browser you can visit localhost:3000/api/v1/workouts?mode=amrap and you'll receive all \"AMRAP\" workouts that are stored:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.48.57.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.48.57\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.48.57.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.48.57.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-30-um-15.48.57.png 1110w\" width=\"1110\" height=\"775\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you leave the query parameter out, you should get all workouts like before. You can try it further with adding \"for%20time\" as the value for the \"mode\" parameter (remember --&gt; \"%20\" means \"whitespace\") and you should receive all workouts that have the mode \"For Time\" if there are any stored. </p><p>When typing in a value that is not stored, that you should receive an empty array.</p><p>The parameters for sorting and pagination follow the same philosophy. Let's look at a few features we could possibly implement:</p><ul><li>Receive all workouts that require a barbell: <strong>/api/v1/workouts?equipment=barbell</strong></li><li>Get only 5 workouts: <strong>/api/v1/workouts?length=5</strong></li><li>When using pagination, receive the second page: <strong>/api/v1/workouts?page=2</strong></li><li>Sort the workouts in the response in descending order by their creation date: <strong>/api/v1/workouts?sort=-createdAt</strong></li><li>You can also combine the parameters, to get the last 10 updated workouts for example: <strong>/api/v1/workouts?sort=-updatedAt&amp;length=10</strong></li></ul><h3 id=\"use-data-caching-for-performance-improvements\">Use data caching for performance improvements</h3><p>Using a data cache is also a great practice to improve the overall experience and performance of our API.</p><p>It makes a lot of sense to use a cache to serve data from, when the data is an often requested resource or/and querying that data from the database is a heavy lift and may take multiple seconds.</p><p>You can store this type of data inside your cache and serve it from there instead of going to the database every time to query the data.</p><p>One important thing you have to keep in mind when serving data from a cache is that this data can become outdated. So you have to make sure that the data inside the cache is always up to date.</p><p>There are many different solutions out there. One appropriate example is to use <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis\">redis</a> or the express middleware <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/apicache\">apicache</a>.</p><p>I'd like to go with apicache, but if you want to use Redis, I can highly recommend that you check out their great <a href=\"https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/references/client_references/client_nodejs/\">docs</a>.</p><p>Let's think a second about a scenario in our API where a cache would make sense. I think requesting to receive all workouts would effectively be served from our cache.</p><p>First, let's install our middleware:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm i apicache</code></pre><p>Now, we have to import it into our workout router and configure it.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst apicache = require(\"apicache\");\nconst workoutController = require(\"../../controllers/workoutController\");\nconst recordController = require(\"../../controllers/recordController\");\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n// *** ADD ***\nconst cache = apicache.middleware;\n\n// *** ADD ***\nrouter.get(\"/\", cache(\"2 minutes\"), workoutController.getAllWorkouts);\n\nrouter.get(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.getOneWorkout);\n\nrouter.get(\"/:workoutId/records\", recordController.getRecordForWorkout);\n\nrouter.post(\"/\", workoutController.createNewWorkout);\n\nrouter.patch(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.updateOneWorkout);\n\nrouter.delete(\"/:workoutId\", workoutController.deleteOneWorkout);\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre><p>Getting started is pretty straightforward, right? We can define a new cache by calling <strong>apicache.middleware </strong>and use it as a middleware inside our get route. You just have to put it as a parameter between the actual path and our workout controller.</p><p>Inside there you can define how long your data should be cached. For the sake of this tutorial I've chosen two minutes. The time depends on how fast or how often your data inside your cache changes.</p><p>Let's test things out!</p><p>Inside Postman or another HTTP client of your choice, define a new request that gets all workouts. I've done it inside the browser until now, but I'd like to visualize the response times better for you. That's the reason why I'm requesting the resource via Postman right now.</p><p>Let's call our request for the first time:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.46-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.46-1\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.46-1.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.46-1.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.46-1.png 1009w\" width=\"1009\" height=\"548\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>As you can see it took our API 22.93 ms to respond. Once our cache is empty again (after two minutes) it has to be filled again. This happens with our first request.</p><p>So in the case above, the data was NOT served from our cache. It took the \"regular\" way from the database and filled our cache.</p><p>Now, with our second request we receive a shorter response time, because it was directly served from the cache:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.59-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.59-1\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.59-1.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.59-1.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-26-um-15.36.59-1.png 1010w\" width=\"1010\" height=\"502\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>We were able to serve three times faster than in our previous request! All thanks to our cache.</p><p>In our example we've cached just one route, but you can also cache all routes by implementing it like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/index.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst apicache = require(\"apicache\");\nconst v1WorkoutRouter = require(\"./v1/routes/workoutRoutes\");\n\nconst app = express();\n// *** ADD ***\nconst cache = apicache.middleware;\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n// *** ADD ***\napp.use(cache(\"2 minutes\"));\napp.use(\"/api/v1/workouts\", v1WorkoutRouter);\n\napp.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`API is listening on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n</code></pre><p>There's one <strong>important</strong> thing I'd like to note here when it comes to caching. While it seems to solve a lot of problems for you, it also can bring some problems into your application.</p><p>A few things you have to be aware of when using a cache:</p><ul><li>you always have to make sure that the data inside the cache is up to date because you don't want to serve outdated data </li><li>while the first request is being processed and the cache is about to be filled and more requests are coming in, you have to decide if you delay those other requests and serve the data from the cache or if they also receive data straight from the database like the first request</li><li>it's another component inside your infrastructure if you're choosing a distributed cache like Redis (so you have to ask yourself if it really makes sense to use it)</li></ul><p>Here's how to do it usually:</p><p>I like to start as simple and as clean as possible with everything I build. The same goes for API's. </p><p>When I start building an API and there are no particular reasons to use a cache straight away, I leave it out and see what happens over time. When reasons arise to use a cache, I can implement it then.</p><h3 id=\"good-security-practices\">Good security practices</h3><p>Wow! This has been quite a great journey so far. We've touched on many important points and extended our API accordingly.</p><p>We've spoken about best practices to increase the usability and performance of our API. Security is also a key factor for API's. You can build the best API, but when it is a vulnerable piece of software running on a server it becomes useless and dangerous.</p><p>The first and absolute must have is to use SSL/TLS because it's a standard nowadays for communications on the internet. It's even more important for API's where private data is send between the client and our API.</p><p>If you've got resources that should only be available to authenticated users, you should protect them with an authentication check. </p><p>In Express, for example, you can implement it as a middleware like we did with our cache for specific routes and check first if the request is authenticated before it accesses a resource.</p><p>There may be also resources or interactions with our API we don't want to allow every user to request. Then you should come up with a role system for your users. So you have to add another checking logic to that route and validate if the user has the privilege to access this resource.</p><p>User roles would also make sense in our use case when we only want specific users (like coaches) to create, update, and delete our workouts and records. Reading can be for everyone (also \"regular\" members).</p><p>This can be handled inside another middleware we use for the routes we'd like to protect. For example our POST request to /api/v1/workouts for creating a new workout. </p><p>Inside the first middleware we'll check if the user is authenticated. If this is true, we'll go to the next middleware, that would be the one for checking the user's role. If the user has the appropriate role for accessing this resource the request is be passed to the corresponding controller.</p><p>Inside the route handler it would look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js\n...\n\n// Custom made middlewares\nconst authenticate = require(\"../../middlewares/authenticate\");\nconst authorize = require(\"../../middlewares/authorize\");\n\nrouter.post(\"/\", authenticate, authorize, workoutController.createNewWorkout);\n\n...</code></pre><p>To read further and get some more best practices on that topic, I can suggest reading <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/security-essentials/\">this article</a>.</p><h3 id=\"document-your-api-properly\">Document your API properly</h3><p>I know that documentation is definitely not a favorite task of developers, but it's a necessary thing to do. Especially when it comes to an API.</p><p>Some people say:</p><blockquote>\"An API is just as good as it's documentation\"</blockquote><p>I think there's a lot truth in this statement because if an API is not well documented it can't be used properly and therefore becomes useless. The documentation helps make developers' lives a lot easier, too.</p><p>Always remember that the documentation is usually the first interaction consumers have with your API. The faster users can understand the documentation, the faster they can use the API.</p><p>So, it's our job to implement a good and precise documentation. There are some great tools out there that make our lives easier.</p><p>Like in other fields of computer science there's also some sort of standard for documenting API's called <a href=\"https://swagger.io/specification/\">OpenAPI Specification</a>.</p><p>Let's see how we can create some documentation that justifies that specification. We'll use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express\">swagger-ui-express</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-jsdoc\">swagger-jsdoc</a> packages to accomplish this. You'll be amazed how awesome this is in a second!</p><p>First, we setup our bare structure for our documentation. Because we've planned to have different versions of our API, the docs will be a bit different, too. That's the reason why I'd like to define our swagger file to spin up our documentation inside the corresponding version folder.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Install required npm packages \nnpm i swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express \n\n# Create a new file to setup the swagger docs \ntouch src/v1/swagger.js</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/swagger.js\nconst swaggerJSDoc = require(\"swagger-jsdoc\");\nconst swaggerUi = require(\"swagger-ui-express\");\n\n// Basic Meta Informations about our API\nconst options = {\n  definition: {\n    openapi: \"3.0.0\",\n    info: { title: \"Crossfit WOD API\", version: \"1.0.0\" },\n  },\n  apis: [\"./src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js\", \"./src/database/Workout.js\"],\n};\n\n// Docs in JSON format\nconst swaggerSpec = swaggerJSDoc(options);\n\n// Function to setup our docs\nconst swaggerDocs = (app, port) =&gt; {\n  // Route-Handler to visit our docs\n  app.use(\"/api/v1/docs\", swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerSpec));\n  // Make our docs in JSON format available\n  app.get(\"/api/v1/docs.json\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n    res.send(swaggerSpec);\n  });\n  console.log(\n    `Version 1 Docs are available on http://localhost:${port}/api/v1/docs`\n  );\n};\n\nmodule.exports = { swaggerDocs };\n</code></pre><p>So, the setup is pretty straightforward. We've defined some basic metadata of our API, created the docs in JSON format, and created a function that makes our docs available. </p><p>To control if everything is up and running, we log a simple message to the console where we can find our docs.</p><p>This will be the function we'll use in our root file, where we created the Express server to make sure that the docs are booted up as well.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/index.js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\nconst v1WorkoutRouter = require(\"./v1/routes/workoutRoutes\");\n// *** ADD ***\nconst { swaggerDocs: V1SwaggerDocs } = require(\"./v1/swagger\");\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(\"/api/v1/workouts\", v1WorkoutRouter);\n\napp.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`API is listening on port ${PORT}`);\n  /// *** ADD ***\n  V1SwaggerDocs(app, PORT);\n});\n</code></pre><p>Now you should see inside your terminal where your development server is running:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-28-um-20.23.51-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-28-um-20.23.51-1\" width=\"496\" height=\"64\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>And when you visit localhost:3000/api/v1/docs, you should see our docs page already:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-28-um-20.25.00-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-28-um-20.25.00-1\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-28-um-20.25.00-1.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-28-um-20.25.00-1.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-28-um-20.25.00-1.png 1392w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1392\" height=\"754\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I'm amazed every time again how nicely this works. Now, the basic structure is setup and we can start to implement the docs for our endpoints. Let's go!</p><p>When you take a look at <strong>options.apis</strong> in our swagger.js file, you will see that we've included the path to our workout routes and to the workout file inside our database folder. This is the most important thing in the setup that will make the whole magic happen.</p><p>Having those files defined inside our swagger options will allow us to use comments that are referencing OpenAPI and having syntax like in yaml files, that are necessary to setup our docs.</p><p>Now we're ready to create docs for our first endpoint! Let's jump right into it.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// In src/v1/routes/workoutRoutes.js\n...\n\n/**\n * @openapi\n * /api/v1/workouts:\n *   get:\n *     tags:\n *       - Workouts\n *     responses:\n *       200:\n *         description: OK\n *         content:\n *           application/json:\n *             schema:\n *               type: object\n *               properties:\n *                 status:\n *                   type: string\n *                   example: OK\n *                 data:\n *                   type: array \n *                   items: \n *                     type: object\n */\nrouter.get(\"/\", cache(\"2 minutes\"), workoutController.getAllWorkouts);\n\n...</code></pre><p>This is basically the whole magic to add an endpoint to our swagger docs. You can look up all the specifications to describe an endpoint in their <a href=\"https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/\">great docs</a>.</p><p>When you reload your docs page, you should see the following:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-29-um-07.21.51-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-29-um-07.21.51-1\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-29-um-07.21.51-1.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-29-um-07.21.51-1.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-29-um-07.21.51-1.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/Bildschirmfoto-2022-04-29-um-07.21.51-1.png 1675w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1675\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This should look very familiar if you've already worked with API's that have OpenAPI documentation.

React. And today I'm still using it at my day job as a Software Developer and in my own side projects.</p><p>During that time I've come across a lot of \"typical\" issues. So I searched around and found some best practices that I've integrated into my workflow, and I've come up with things that have made my life or my team members' lives easier. </p><p>I also faced challenges along the way that I didn't solve in the best way at the time, and I want to approach them in a better way in the future.</p><p>That's the reason I wrote this guide. I think of it like a collection of tips I'd have given myself two years ago when I started out.</p><h2 id=\"table-of-contents-\">Table of contents:</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#three-major-challenges-react-developers-face\">Three Major Challenges React Developers Face</a></li><li><a href=\"#learn-the-building-blocks-of-react\">Learn The Building Blocks of React</a></li><li><a href=\"#learn-how-to-build-clean-performant-and-maintainable-react-components\">Learn How to Build Clean, Performant and Maintainable React Components</a></li><li><a href=\"#tips-to-help-you-write-better-react-code-the-cherries-on-top\">Tips to Help You Write Better React Code – The Cherries on Top</a></li><li><a href=\"#final-words\">Final Words</a></li></ul><p>First and foremost, you'll get to know the <strong>three major challenges</strong> every React developer has to face. This is important because when you are aware of potential challenges, you'll understand the reasons behind these best practices in a deeper way. Having this mindset from the beginning also helps you when designing your components or organizing your project.</p><p>After that first important step, I'll introduce you to the <strong>three best practices</strong>. They're a mixture of theoretical and practical tips with code examples. I try to minimize <em>hello world problems</em> and come up with code I've seen in the <em>real world</em>. </p><h2 id=\"three-major-challenges-react-developers-face\">Three Major Challenges React Developers Face</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/christian-erfurt-sxQz2VfoFBE-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"christian-erfurt-sxQz2VfoFBE-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/christian-erfurt-sxQz2VfoFBE-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/christian-erfurt-sxQz2VfoFBE-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/christian-erfurt-sxQz2VfoFBE-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2022/01/christian-erfurt-sxQz2VfoFBE-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>During my two years of using React on a daily basis, I've recognized three major challenges that React developers face when building their apps. Ignoring these challenges might bring hard times that harm the growth of your app. </p><p>So keep these challenges in mind when orchestrating your app, as it'll save you time and energy. </p><h3 id=\"-maintainability\">⚙️ Maintainability</h3><p>This goes hand in hand with <em>reusability.</em> At the beginning when the application and the components are very lightweight, they're easy to maintain. But once the requirements start growing, components tend to become very complex and therefore less maintainable.</p><p>I've often seen a component that has many different cases, each representing a different outcome. The JSX is flooded with conditional renderings (ternary operators and simple <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operators), classnames are applied conditionally, or the component uses a huge <code>switch</code> statement. There are many possible prop and state values, each responsible for a different outcome.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with those techniques in and of themselves, in my opinion. But I think everyone should develop a feeling for when a component starts to become less maintainable and when these techniques become overused. We'll learn how to control this better later on in the article.</p><p>The problem (and I've been guilty of this as well) is that the more complexity and different outcomes a component has (polymorphism), the more difficult it becomes to maintain. </p><p>To be honest, the root cause is often laziness, not enough experience, or time pressure to refactor a component properly in order to make it more maintainable and cleaner.</p><p>Another key factor I've seen is no or little testing. I know, testing is not a type of work many developers love, but it can really help you on the long run. Testing itself won't be a major topic in this post, so keep your eyes open for another blog post of mine about it.</p><h3 id=\"-solid-understanding-of-react\">🧠 Solid Understanding of React</h3><p>Another root cause for problems React devs have is a poor basic understanding of how React works under the hood. I've been there, too.</p><p>I've seen many people jumping too fast into intermediate or advanced concepts without having a solid foundation. But this isn't only particular to React. It's a general problem in programming.</p><p>Not having a solid understanding of React can also cause issues for you as a developer. I remember having headaches when I wanted to use different component lifecycles but didn't know how to actually use them. So I had to take a few steps back and go deeper into that topic.</p><p>Because I think it's one of the most important things, I've dedicated a whole chapter to it in this blog post below.</p><h3 id=\"-scalability\">📈 Scalability</h3><p>This challenge goes hand in hand with <em>maintainability</em>. It is not only specific to React, but applies generally in software. </p><p>I've learned that crafting excellent software is not only about UX, clean code patterns, or clever architecture, for example. For me, the quality of a software also rises or falls with its ability to scale.</p><p>To me, many things come into play that increase the scalability of software. You'll learn my most important tips in this article.</p><p>I think when you keep <em>maintainability</em> and <em>scalability</em> in mind when orchestrating your components and organizing your project structure, you'll less likely end up with a mess of source code that needs major refactoring.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-learn-react\">How to Learn React</h1><p>Alright, now let's dive deeper into some best practices for learning React.</p><h2 id=\"learn-the-building-blocks-of-react\">Learn the Building Blocks of React</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/brett-jordan-Lzfxzip-pNI-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"brett-jordan-Lzfxzip-pNI-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/brett-jordan-Lzfxzip-pNI-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/brett-jordan-Lzfxzip-pNI-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/brett-jordan-Lzfxzip-pNI-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2022/01/brett-jordan-Lzfxzip-pNI-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>As we discussed briefly above, manifesting the building blocks is not only relevant to learning React, but to other technologies or programming languages as well. You can't build a skyscraper on a sandy foundation and expect it to be solid.</p><p>This might seem obvious to many of you, but I've seen developers who jumped into the intermediate or advanced concepts of React without really understanding the basics. </p><p>This also true for Javascript in general. I'm a huge believer that learning React doesn't make sense if you don't have a solid foundation in Vanilla Javascript.</p><p>So, if that sounds familiar to you and you're thinking about learning React but not feeling very comfortable with Vanilla Javascript already, spend some more time on strengthening Javascript first. It will save you a lot of headaches and time in the future.</p><p>Here's a helpful guide to the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/top-javascript-concepts-to-know-before-learning-react/\">top JavaScript concepts you need to know before diving into React</a> if you want to review.</p><p>But knowing the basics alone is not enough for me. It's kind of mandatory to know how React works under the hood. If you want to become a good React developer (which I assume you do, because you're reading this article), you have to know the tool you're using. This is beneficial for you as a developer and for your clients as well.</p><p>On the one hand it can save you a lot of time debugging your application. On the other hand it makes you more efficient because you don't have to take some steps back to re-learn the basics again and again. You basically know what you're talking about.</p><p>Of course, you can't know it all and you shouldn't stress yourself out on that topic. You'll learn more and more as you go through practical problems and build more projects. But with a good solid knowledge you are equipped well from the beginning.</p><p>Okey, that makes sense. But you might be wondering what exactly you need to know in order to have a solid foundation in React?</p><p>As a bare minimum, you should understand all the topics inside the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html\"><strong>Main Concepts</strong> Chapter</a> inside the official React Docs.</p><p>Another <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">chapter you should be very familiar with is the one on <strong>Hooks</strong></a> because they've become a convention and are used everywhere, especially in third party React packages. </p><p>Of course there are some you might use more often like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>, but understanding the other ones like <code>useMemo</code>, <code>useCallback</code> or <code>useRef</code> is also essential.</p><p>There's also <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html\">another chapter called <strong>Advanced Guides</strong></a> that I wouldn't consider to be mandatory at the beginning, but I'd highly recommend that you grasp those concepts during your React journey. </p><p>As always, it's often easier to understand advanced topics when you already have some practical experience. But the more of those things you understand early on, the better.</p><p>Of course you shouldn't limit yourself to just only following the React docs. Working through an online course that covers those building blocks, watching tutorials or reading other blog posts is also part of building a solid foundation. So, test what works best for you.</p><p>If I had to choose the most important concepts to know at a bare minimum, I'd suggest these:</p><ul><li>what is \"state\"?</li><li>ups and downs of class and functional components</li><li>what are component re-renderings and how do they work?</li><li>how to trigger re-renderings</li><li>different component lifecycles and how to interact with them</li><li>Virtual DOM</li><li>Benefits of CSR (Client Side Rendering) and SSR (Server Side Rendering) in general and in React</li><li>Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components</li><li>State Lifting</li><li>at least one global state management technology (Context API, Redux/Toolkit, Recoil)</li><li>Component Patterns (especially how to choose the right pattern)</li></ul><h2 id=\"learn-how-to-build-clean-performant-and-maintainable-react-components\">Learn How to Build Clean, Performant and Maintainable React Components</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/wesley-tingey-mvLyHPRGLCs-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"wesley-tingey-mvLyHPRGLCs-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/wesley-tingey-mvLyHPRGLCs-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/wesley-tingey-mvLyHPRGLCs-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/wesley-tingey-mvLyHPRGLCs-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2022/01/wesley-tingey-mvLyHPRGLCs-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1295\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I know – this is the dream of every programmer (or at least I hope it is). And for me, this ability separates a good programmer from a great programmer. The fun part is that it's never really completed because there's always something to learn and to improve.</p><p>Following these best practices won't only make it easier for you, but also for your teammates. I've seen development teams who created a <em>style guide</em> where they defined important cornerstones about how they're writing code. Very smart idea if you'd ask me.</p><p>Some of them were:</p><ul><li>use functional components (like arrow-functions)</li><li>don't use inline-styles</li><li>maintain a proper import structure (third-party imports first --&gt; internal imports below)</li><li>format your code before committing</li></ul><p>And so on.</p><p>Of course you can get very detailed about it. This depends on your team. I personally don't like very detailed style guides because I think you should have some type of freedom as a skilled developer and shouldn't be restricted too much. </p><p>But a style guide in general is a good way to outline and keep up best practices and makes sure your team is on the same page regarding some important areas. I think this increases teamwork and output tremendously.</p><p>Let's take a look what those best practices actually are to create components that are clean, performant, and maintainable. Make yourself comfortable, grab something to take a notes with, and enjoy!</p><h3 id=\"-create-a-good-folder-structure\">📁 Create a good folder-structure</h3><p>Organizing your files and folders inside your React application is mandatory for maintainability and scalability. </p><p>A <strong>good</strong> folder structure depends on the size of your application and your team. So there's no general answer to that. Especially because this is a highly opinionated topic and depends also on personal preferences.</p><p>But over the time, some best practices for different sizes of an application have evolved.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/\">This great blog post</a> goes through five different application sizes and introduces good ideas of how to organize your files and folders. Having this in mind when planning or starting your application can make a huge difference on the long run.</p><p>Don't over-engineer it, but try your best maintain a proper structure that is best suited for your current application and your team size.</p><h3 id=\"-maintain-a-structured-import-order\">👇 Maintain a structured import order</h3><p>If you've already got some experience in React, you might have seen files that are bloated with a lot of import statements. They might also be mixed up with external imports from third-party packages and internal imports like other components, util functions, styles and many more.</p><p>Real World Example (cut):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-code-card\"><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from \"react\";\nimport Typography from \"@material-ui/core/Typography\";\nimport Divider from \"@material-ui/core/Divider\";\nimport Title from \"../components/Title\";\nimport Navigation from \"../components/Navigation\";\nimport DialogActions from \"@material-ui/core/DialogActions\"\nimport { getServiceURL } from '../../utils/getServiceURL\";\nimport Grid from \"@material-ui/core/Grid\";\nimport Paragraph from \"../components/Paragprah\";\nimport { sectionTitleEnum } from \"../../constants\";\nimport { useSelector, useDispatch } from \"react-redux\";\nimport Box from \"@material-ui/core/Box\";\nimport axios from 'axios';\nimport { DatePicker } from \"@material-ui/pickers\";\nimport { Formik } from \"formik\";\nimport CustomButton from \"../components/CustomButton\";\n...</code></pre><figcaption>In reality the imports span over 55 lines.</figcaption></figure><p>You probably recognize the deal here. It's difficult to distinguish what are all the third-party and the local (internal) imports. They are not grouped and seem to be all over the place. </p><p>Better Version:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from \"react\";\nimport { useSelector, useDispatch } from \"react-redux\";\nimport { Formik } from \"formik\";\nimport axios from 'axios';\nimport Typography from \"@material-ui/core/Typography\";\nimport Divider from \"@material-ui/core/Divider\";\nimport Box from \"@material-ui/core/Box\";\nimport DialogActions from \"@material-ui/core/DialogActions\";\nimport Grid from \"@material-ui/core/Grid\";\nimport { DatePicker } from \"@material-ui/pickers\";\n\nimport { getServiceURL } from '../../utils/getServiceURL\";\nimport { sectionTitleEnum } from \"../../constants\";\nimport CustomButton from \"../components/CustomButton\";\nimport Title from \"../components/Title\";\nimport Navigation from \"../components/Navigation\";\nimport Paragraph from \"../components/Paragraph\";\n...</code></pre><p>The structure is clearer and it's very easy to distinguish where the external and internal imports are. Of course you can optimize it more if you are using more named imports (if that's possible! :) ). That allows you to import all the components that are coming from material-ui all on one line.</p><p>I've seen other developers who like to split the import structure up in three different parts:</p><p>Built-In (like 'react') --&gt; External (third-party node modules) --&gt; Internal.</p><p>You can manage it every time by yourself or let a <strong>linter</strong> do the job. <a href=\"https://dev.to/otamnitram/sorting-your-imports-correctly-in-react-213m\">Here's</a> a great article about how to configure your linter for your React app to maintain a proper import structure.</p><h3 id=\"-learn-different-component-patterns\">📔 Learn different component patterns</h3><p>To ensure you don't end up with unmaintainable and unscalable spaghetti code, learning different component patterns is essential as you become more experienced in React. </p><p>But this is not all. Knowing the different patterns is a good foundation. But the most important aspect about it is that you know <strong>when </strong>to use which pattern for your problem. </p><p>Every pattern serves a certain purpose. For example the <strong>compound component pattern </strong>avoids unnecessary <em>prop-drilling</em> of many component levels. So, the next time you begin to do pass props through five component levels to finally reach the component that is interested in the props, you start to orchestrate the components differently.</p><p>One quick side note here about props-drilling, because I've had many discussions about it in the past. There're many opinions out there as to whether it's bad or not. As for me, I like to try to think about a different way / pattern if I start to pass props through more than two component levels. </p><p>This fact makes you more efficient as a developer and makes the components you write more maintainable or scalable. Having those patterns in your toolkit makes you also stand out from other React developers. I highly encourage you to do your own research, but <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-advanced-react-patterns/\">this</a> Udemy course helped me very much.</p><h3 id=\"-use-a-linter-and-follow-its-rules\">🔒Use a linter and follow its rules</h3><p>A linter doesn't only help you in terms of maintaining a distinguishable import order of your dependencies. It helps you write better code in general. </p><p>When you're using <em>create-react-app</em>, there's already ESLint configured, but you can also set it up completely on your own or extend the rules of a pre-configured ruleset.</p><p>A linter basically observes the JavaScript code you're writing and reminds you of errors you'd more likely catch when executing the code. It took a while for me to really value the use of a linter, but today I can't imagine working without it. </p><p>Having the linter is one thing, but following its rules is another. Of course you can disable it. Either for a specific line of code or for the whole file itself. There may be cases where this makes sense, but from my experience they're pretty rare.</p><p>Another great benefit is that you can also adjust style checking. This is especially helpful for teams. Once you agreed upon certain conventions of how you write your code and how it should be formatted, you can easily combine ESLint with something like JSPrettify.</p><h3 id=\"-test-your-code\">🧪 Test your code</h3><p>I know, testing is likely not your favorite task as a developer. I used to be like that. At the beginning it seemed to be an unnecessary and disturbing task. This might be true for the short run. But in the long run – and when the application grows – it is vital.</p><p>For me, testing has become a practice that ensures I'm doing my job more professionally and delivering higher quality software.</p><p>Basically there's nothing wrong with manual testing by a human and that shouldn't be avoided completely. But imagine you're integrating a new feature and want to make sure that nothing is broken. This can be a time consuming task and is prone to human error. </p><p>During the time you're writing tests you're already in the thinking process of how to organize your code in order to pass this test. For me this is always helpful because I recognize what pitfalls might arise and that I have to keep an eye on them. </p><p>You're not directly jumping into writing your code either (which I wouldn't recommend at all), but you're thinking first about the goal. </p><p>For example \"What should that particular component do? What important edge cases might arise that I have to test? Can I make the component more pure that it only serves one purpose? ...\"</p><p>Having a vision for the code you're about to write also helps you to maintain a sharp focus on serving that vision. &nbsp;</p><p>Tests can also serve as a kind of documentation, because for a new developer who is new to the codebase it can be very helpful to understand the different parts of the software and how they're expected to work. </p><p>So, don't avoid testing because it seems to be <em>extra work. </em>The reality is that it can save you extra work in the future when you set it up properly.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html\">\"Testing\" chapter inside the React Docs</a>, go through a few tutorials on testing in React, and just start writing your first small TDD application or implement tests into an app you're currently working on.</p><h3 id=\"-integrate-typescript-or-at-least-use-default-props-and-prop-types-\">🧰 Integrate Typescript (or at least use default props and prop types)</h3><p>I remember my first React project as a software developer where our team received a project that was already basically written by another company. Then we had to build the client's project upon it, and Typescript had already been integrated.</p><p>Up to that point, my teammates and I hadn't had much experience in TypeScript since we all came from a vanilla JavaScript background. </p><p>After a few weeks of working with that project, we felt that TypeScript wasn't a benefit, but more an obstacle that blocked us in our workflow. We also weren't really using the benefits of it because we defined everything with type <em>any </em>to suppress the Typescript warnings.</p><p>That led us to the decision to remove TypeScript from the project and to work on our known terrain with vanilla JavaScript. This went well at first, but the more complex our project became, the more type errors emerged. So we doubted our decision a lot of getting completely rid of TypeScript. But those things can happen and gave us valuable experiences for the future.</p><p>This circumstance led me to give TypeScript another chance, and I learned it in my spare time. After building some side projects with it, I can't imagine a life without it anymore. </p><p>Using TypeScript has many upsides like static type checking, better code completion in your IDE (intellisense), improved developer experience, and catching type errors while you write the code – just to name a few.</p><p>On the other hand it can have some challenges of course, because if you're not coming from a background with strongly typed languages (like Java or C#) it might be harder at the beginning to grasp it. </p><p>But I can say that it's really worth it to learn and to integrate it. <a href=\"https://blog.bitsrc.io/5-strong-reasons-to-use-typescript-with-react-bc987da5d907\">Here's</a> a nice article that can help you out of getting an overview of the ups and downs using Typescript in React applications. And <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-your-react-app-with-typescript/\">here's a tutorial</a> on how to code your React apps in TypeScript.</p><p>There may be reasons you don't want to use TypeScript inside your React application. That's fine. But at a bare minimum I'd recommend that you use <strong>prop-types</strong> and <strong>default-props </strong>for your components to ensure you don't mess up your props. </p><h3 id=\"-use-lazy-loading-code-splitting\">💎 Use lazy-loading / code splitting</h3><p>If you've spent some time in the JavaScript and React universe, you've most likely stumbled across <strong>bundling</strong>. For those of you who are hearing this term for the first time, let's see what the official React docs say:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p>Most React apps will have their files “bundled” using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify. Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a “bundle”. This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Basically this is a great technique, but with the growth of your app comes a challenge. Your bundle starts growing as well. Especially when you're using big third-party libraries like three.js. </p><p>The pitfall is that this bundle needs to be always loaded completely, even when the user needs only a fraction of the code. This leads to performance issues because it can take an unnecessarily long time to load up your app. </p><p>To avoid this, there's a technique called <strong>code splitting </strong>where you split up your bundle into the pieces of the code your user needs. This is supported by the most common bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, and Browserify. The great benefit of it is that you can create multiple bundles and load them dynamically.</p><p>Splitting up your bundle helps you to <strong>lazy load </strong>only the things that are needed by the user. </p><p>To illustrate this, imagine you're going into a grocery store and just want to grab some bananas, apples, and bread. In that case you aren't buying the whole range of the store and then grab your bananas, apples and bread out of it. You're just interested in a fraction of the range. So why would you buy everything? It would take way longer and is of course more expensive.</p><p>I think it's important to be aware of the potential challenges that can arise as your app grows, and that there are certain techniques at hand to get rid of those issues. For further reading checkout the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html\">React docs.</a> </p><h3 id=\"-extract-reusable-logic-into-custom-hooks\">🗄️ Extract reusable logic into custom hooks</h3><p>According to the React docs, </p><blockquote><em>Hooks allow us to reuse stateful logic without changing our component hierarchy.</em></blockquote><p>Basically they're a better solution to the techniques that were used before in combination with class components. If you've been coding for a while, you might remember the use of <strong>Higher Order Components</strong> or <strong>render props. </strong></p><p>Whenever you find yourself in a situation where you have to reuse the same stateful logic that is already used in another functional component, that's a great time to create a custom hook. Inside it you encapsulate the logic and just have to call the hook as a function inside your components.</p><p>Let's take a look at a quick example where we need to update our UI according to the screen size and want to keep track of the current window size when resizing the browser window manually.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-code-card\"><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const ScreenDimensions = () =&gt; {\n  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({\n    width: undefined,\n    height: undefined,\n  });\n  \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    function handleResize() {\n      setWindowSize({\n        width: window.innerWidth,\n        height: window.innerHeight,\n      });\n    }\n    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);\n    handleResize();\n    return () =&gt; window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);\n  }, []);\n  \n  return (\n  \t&lt;&gt;\n    \t&lt;p&gt;Current screen width: {windowSize.width}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Current screen height: {windowSize.height}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><figcaption>Thanks to: https://usehooks.com/useWindowSize/</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, the solution is pretty straightforward and there's nothing wrong with defining it like this.</p><p>Now comes the tricky part. Imagine we'd like to use the exact logic in another component, where we'll render a different UI (one for smartphones and one for desktops) based on the current screen size.</p><p>Of course we could just copy the logic, paste it in and we're done. But this is not a good practice, as you might know from the DRY principle. </p><p>If we'd like to adjust our logic, we have to do it in both components. And when we paste our logic in even more components, it becomes less maintainable and more error prone. </p><p>So, what would you normally do in a vanilla JavaScript project? You'd most likely define a function that encapsulates the logic and can be used in many different places. That's exactly what we'll achieve with hooks. They are nothing more than JavaScript functions but with some React specialities because they're using React hooks.</p><p>Let's see how our custom hook would look:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const useWindowSize = () =&gt; {\n  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({\n    width: undefined,\n    height: undefined,\n  });\n  \n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    function handleResize() {\n      setWindowSize({\n        width: window.innerWidth,\n        height: window.innerHeight,\n      });\n    }\n    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);\n    handleResize();\n    return () =&gt; window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);\n  }, []);\n  \n  return windowSize;\n}</code></pre><p>Now let's simply call it inside our <strong>ScreenDimensions</strong> component:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const ScreenDimensions = () =&gt; {\n  const windowSize = useWindowSize()\n  \n  return (\n  \t&lt;&gt;\n    \t&lt;p&gt;Current screen width: {windowSize.width}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Current screen height: {windowSize.height}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><p>This enables us to just call the custom hook in any other component and save the return value (which is the current window size) in a variable that we can use inside the component.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const ResponsiveView = () =&gt; {\n  const windowSize = useWindowSize()\n  \n  return (\n  \t&lt;&gt;\n    \t{windowSize.width &lt;= 960 ? (\n          &lt;SmartphoneView /&gt;\n        ) : (\n          &lt;DesktopView /&gt;\t\n        )}\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><h3 id=\"-handle-errors-effectively\">🖥️ Handle errors effectively</h3><p>Handling errors effectively is often overlooked and underestimated by many developers. Like many other best practices this seems to be an afterthought at the beginning. You want to make the code work and don't want to \"waste\" time thinking much about errors. </p><p>But once you've become more experienced and have been in nasty situations where better error handling could have saved you a lot of energy (and valuable time of course), you realize that it's mandatory in the long run to have a solid error handling inside your application. Especially when the application is deployed to production.</p><p>But what exactly does <em>error handling</em> mean in the React world? There are some different parts that play a role. One is to <strong>catch</strong> errors, another one to <strong>handle</strong> the UI accordingly, and the last one to <strong>log </strong>them properly.</p><h4 id=\"react-error-boundary\">React Error Boundary</h4><p>This is a custom class component that is used as a wrapper of your entire application. Of course you can wrap the ErrorBoundary component also around components that are deeper in the component tree to render a more specific UI, for example. Basically it's also a best practice to wrap the ErrorBoundary around a component that is error prone.</p><p>With the lifecycle method <code>componentDidCatch()</code><strong> </strong>you're able to catch errors during the rendering phase or any other lifecycles of the child components. So when an error arises during that phase, it bubbles up and gets caught by the ErrorBoundary component. </p><p>If you're using a logging service (which I also highly recommend), this is a great place to connect to it.</p><p>The static function <code>getDerivedStateFromError()</code> is called during the render phase and is used to update the state of your ErrorBoundary Component. Based on your state, you can conditionally render an error UI.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n    return { hasError: true };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {\n    //log the error to an error reporting service\n    errorService.log({ error, errorInfo });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return &lt;h1&gt;Oops, something went wrong.&lt;/h1&gt;;\n    }\n    return this.props.children; \n  }\n}</code></pre><p>The big drawback of this approach is that it doesn't handle errors in asynchronous callbacks, on server-side-rendering, or in event-handlers because they're outside the boundary.</p><h4 id=\"use-try-catch-to-handle-errors-beyond-boundaries\">Use try-catch to handle errors beyond boundaries</h4><p>This technique is effective to catch errors that might occur inside asynchronous callbacks. Let's imagine we're fetching a user's profile data from an API and want to display it inside a Profile Component.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const UserProfile = ({ userId }) =&gt; {\n\tconst [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)\n\tconst [profileData, setProfileData] = useState({})\n    \n    useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    \t// Separate function to make of use of async\n        const getUserDataAsync = async () =&gt; {\n        \ttry {\n            \t// Fetch user data from API\n            \tconst userData = await axios.get(`/users/${userId}`)\n                // Throw error if user data is falsy (will be caught by catch)\n                if (!userData) {\n                \tthrow new Error(\"No user data found\")\n                }\n                // If user data is truthy update state\n                setProfileData(userData.profile)\n            } catch(error) {\n            \t// Log any caught error in the logging service\n            \terrorService.log({ error })\n                // Update state \n                setProfileData(null)\n            } finally {\n            \t// Reset loading state in any case\n                setIsLoading(false)\n            }\n        }\n        \n        getUserDataAsync()\n    }, [])\n    \n    if (isLoading) {\n    \treturn &lt;div&gt;Loading ...&lt;/div&gt;\n    }\n    \n    if (!profileData) {\n    \treturn &lt;ErrorUI /&gt;\n    }\n    \n    return (\n    \t&lt;div&gt;\n        \t...User Profile\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    )\n}</code></pre><p>When the component gets mounted, it starts a GET request to our API to receive the user data for the corresponding userId that we'll get from the props.</p><p>Using try-catch helps us catch any error that might occur during that API call. For example this could be a 404 or a 500 response from the API. </p><p>Once an error gets caught, we're inside the catch block and receive the error as a parameter. Now we're able to log it in our logging service and update the state accordingly to display a custom error UI.</p><h4 id=\"use-the-react-error-boundary-library-personal-recommendation-\">Use the react-error-boundary library (personal recommendation)</h4><p>This library basically melts those two techniques from above together. It simplifies error handling in React and overcomes the limitations of the ErrorBoundary component we've seen above.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary'\n\nconst ErrorComponent = ({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) =&gt; {\n  \n  return (\n    &lt;div role=\"alert\"&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Something went wrong:&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;pre&gt;{error.message}&lt;/pre&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nconst App = () =&gt; {\n  const logError = (error, errorInfo) =&gt; {\n  \terrorService.log({ error, errorInfo })\n  }\n  \n\n  return (\n    &lt;ErrorBoundary \n       FallbackComponent={ErrorComponent}\n       onError={logError}\n    &gt;\n       &lt;MyErrorProneComponent /&gt;\n    &lt;/ErrorBoundary&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre><p>The library exports a component that is made up of the ErrorBoundary functionality we already know and adds some nuances to it. It allows you to pass a <code>FallbackComponent</code> as a prop that should be rendered once an error got caught.</p><p>It also exposes a prop <code>onError</code> which provides a callback function when an error arises. It's great for using it to log the error to a logging service.</p><p>There are some other props that are quite useful. If you'd like to know more, feel free to checkout <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary?activeTab=readme\">the docs.</a></p><p>This library also provides a hook called <code>useErrorHandler()</code> that is meant to catch any errors that are outside the boundaries like event-handlers, in asynchronous code and in server-side-rendering.</p><h4 id=\"logging-errors\">Logging errors</h4><p>Catching and handling errors effectively is one part, logging them properly is another. Once you've set up your error handling inside your application, you need to log them persistently. </p><p>The most frequently used way is the good old <strong>console.log</strong>. This might be good during development when you want a quick log, but once your application is deployed to production it becomes useless. This is because you only see the error inside the user's browser, which is not effective at all. </p><p>When logging errors in production, <strong>you</strong> as the developer want to see the errors in one dedicated place in order to fix them.</p><p>For that reason we need a logging service created by our own or a third-party one. </p><p>When using third-party logging services my personal recommendations is definitely <strong>Sentry.</strong> So I highly encourage you to check it out.</p><h3 id=\"-keep-your-key-prop-unique-across-your-whole-app\">☝️ Keep your key prop unique across your whole app</h3><p>When mapping over an Array to render its data, you always have to define a <strong>key</strong> property for each element. A common practice I've seen and used myself as well is to use simply the <strong>index </strong>of each element as the key prop. </p><p>Using the key prop is important because it helps React to identify the exact element that has changed, is added or is removed. Imagine the state of your component changes and the UI needs to be re-rendered with the new state. React needs to figure out the differences between the previous UI and new UI in order to update it. </p><p>\"What elements are added/removed or have changed?\"</p><p>Therefore the key prop has to be unique. Using the index of the current element makes sure that it is only unique in this particular map function.</p><p>It could look like this, if we'd pretend to show a score history of a football team from the current season:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const SeasonScores = ({ seasonScoresData }) =&gt; {\n\t\n    return (\n    \t&lt;&gt;\n        \t&lt;h3&gt;Our scores in this season:&lt;h3&gt;\n        \t{seasonScoresData.map((score, index) =&gt; (\n    \t\t\t&lt;div key={index}&gt;\n        \t\t\t&lt;p&gt;{score.oponennt}&lt;/p&gt;\n        \t\t\t&lt;p&gt;{score.value}&lt;/p&gt;\n        \t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n    \t\t))}\n        &lt;/&gt;\n    )\n}</code></pre><p>While this is only unique inside this map function here, this could lead to potential issues. It's pretty common to have more than one map function inside your React application or even in one component. </p><p>Let's assume we've got another map-function in our component to display the current roster:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const SeasonScores = ({ seasonScoresData, currentRoster }) =&gt; {\n\t\n    return (\n    \t&lt;&gt;\n        \t&lt;h3&gt;Our scores in this season:&lt;h3&gt;\n        \t{seasonScoresData.map((score, index) =&gt; (\n    \t\t\t&lt;div key={index}&gt;\n        \t\t\t&lt;p&gt;{score.oponennt}&lt;/p&gt;\n        \t\t\t&lt;p&gt;{score.value}&lt;/p&gt;\n        \t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n    \t\t))}\n            &lt;/br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;h3&gt;Our current roster:&lt;h3&gt;\n        \t{currentRoster.map((player, index) =&gt; (\n            \t&lt;div key={index}&gt;\n                \t&lt;p&gt;{player.name}&lt;/p&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{player.position}&lt;/p&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{player.jerseyNumber}&lt;/p&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{player.totalGoals}&lt;/p&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n    \t\t))}\n        &lt;/&gt;\n    )\n}</code></pre><p>Now we end up in the situation where we used many keys twice inside our component. Let's assume we got <strong>14</strong> elements inside <code>seasonScoresData</code> and <strong>30</strong> in <code>currentRoaster</code>. We have used the numbers 0-13 two times as a key prop. Now we're not serving the purpose anymore to have unique key props. </p><p>This could lead to potential problems because React might only re-render only one item and omit the other one. Or it can lead to inefficiencies with updating the UI tree. Check out the recommended blog post at the end of this tip to get a more in depth example.</p><p>To avoid this unwanted behavior, make sure to always use <strong>unique keys across your whole application. </strong>Ideally each item in the Array has got its own unique id that you can use. But this isn't always the case, so you can use an external library like <strong>uuidv4</strong> for generating unique id's.</p><p>With that in mind and with the assumption that every item in both Arrays has an id property, the component would look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const SeasonScores = ({ seasonScoresData, currentRoster }) =&gt; {\n\t\n    return (\n    \t&lt;&gt;\n        \t&lt;h3&gt;Our scores in this season:&lt;h3&gt;\n        \t{seasonScoresData.map((score, index) =&gt; (\n    \t\t\t&lt;div key={score.id}&gt;\n        \t\t\t&lt;p&gt;{score.oponennt}&lt;/p&gt;\n        \t\t\t&lt;p&gt;{score.value}&lt;/p&gt;\n        \t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n    \t\t))}\n            &lt;/br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;h3&gt;Our current roster:&lt;h3&gt;\n        \t{currentRoster.map((player, index) =&gt; (\n            \t&lt;div key={player.id}&gt;\n                \t&lt;p&gt;{player.name}&lt;/p&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{player.position}&lt;/p&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{player.jerseyNumber}&lt;/p&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;{player.totalGoals}&lt;/p&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n    \t\t))}\n        &lt;/&gt;\n    )\n}</code></pre><p>If you want to go into more depth, feel free to check out <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-the-importance-of-the-key-prop-in-react-f2b92ce65f45\">this great post</a> about that topic.</p><h2 id=\"tips-to-help-you-write-better-react-code-the-cherries-on-top\">Tips to Help You Write Better React Code – The Cherries on Top</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/01/joanna-kosinska-_xN7UbcZ33I-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"joanna-kosinska-_xN7UbcZ33I-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/joanna-kosinska-_xN7UbcZ33I-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/joanna-kosinska-_xN7UbcZ33I-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/joanna-kosinska-_xN7UbcZ33I-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2022/01/joanna-kosinska-_xN7UbcZ33I-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I'd like to compare this guide to the process of building a house.

I've created and seen components over the time that have got a lot of different states. So it's natural that they become flooded with a lot of useState hooks.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const CustomersMap = () =&gt; {\n  const [isDataLoading, setIsDataLoading] = useState(false)\n  const [customersData, setCustomersData] = useState([])\n  const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false)\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false)\n  const [hasMapLoaded, setHasMapLoaded] = useState(false)\n  const [mapData, setMapData] = useState({})\n  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({})\n  const [isBtnDisabled, setIsBtnDisabled] = useState(false)\n  \n  ...\n  \n  return ( ... )\n}</code></pre><p>Having a lot of different useState hooks is always a great sign that the size and therefore the complexity of your component is growing. </p><p>If you can create some smaller sub components where you can transfer some state and JSX in, then this is a great way to go. So you're cleaning up your useState hooks and your JSX in one step.</p><p>In our example above, we could put the last two states into a separate component that handles all state and JSX that has to do with a form.</p><p>But there are scenarios where this doesn't make sense, and you have to keep those many different states inside one component. To increase the legibility of your component, there is the <strong>useReducer</strong> hook. </p><p>The official React docs say this about it:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p><code>useReducer</code> is usually preferable to <code>useState</code> when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>With that in mind, the component would like this when using <code>useReducer</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// INITIAL STATE\nconst initialState = {\n  isDataLoading: false,\n  customerData: [],\n  hasError: false,\n  isHovered: false,\n  hasMapLoaded: false,\n  mapData: {},\n  formdata: {},\n  isBtnDisabled: false\n}\n\n// REDUCER\nconst reducer = (state, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'POPULATE_CUSTOMER_DATA':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        customerData: action.payload\n      }\n    case 'LOAD_MAP':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        hasMapLoaded: true\n      }\n    ...\n    ...\n    ...\n    default: {\n      return state\n    }\t\n  }\n}\n\n// COMPONENT\nconst CustomersMap = () =&gt; {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)\n  \n  ...\n  \n  return ( ... )\n}</code></pre><p>The component itself looks cleaner and comes along with some great benefits as you can see inside the docs. If you're used to Redux, the concept of a reducer and how it is built isn't new to you. </p><p>My personal rule is to implement the useReducer hook if my component exceeds four useState hooks, or if the state itself is more complex than just a boolean, for example. It might be an object for a form with some deeper levels inside.</p><h3 id=\"-use-shorthand-for-boolean-props\">🔌 Use shorthand for boolean props</h3><p>Often there are scenarios where you pass boolean props to a component. I've seen a lot of developers doing it like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;RegistrationForm hasPadding={true} withError={true} /&gt;</code></pre><p>But you don't need to do it necessarily like this because the occasion of the prop itself is either truthy (if the prop is passed) or falsy (if the prop is missing).</p><p>A cleaner approach would be:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;RegistrationForm hasPadding withError /&gt;</code></pre><h3 id=\"-avoid-curly-braces-for-string-props\">👎 Avoid curly braces for string props</h3><p>A similar use case like we've seen in the tip before is using string props:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;Paragraph variant={\"h5\"} heading={\"A new book\"} /&gt;</code></pre><p>You don't need the curly braces in that case because you're allowed to directly use strings inside your props. When you want to attach a className to a JSX Element you're most likely using it also directly as a string. </p><p>When you'd like use a JavaScript expression different from a string, you need to use the curly braces. For example if you want to use a number or an object. This is also true for template strings (don't get caught up like I did many times, haha).</p><p>With plain strings, like in the example, it would look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;Paragraph variant=\"h5\" heading=\"A new book\" /&gt;</code></pre><h3 id=\"-erase-non-html-attributes-when-spreading-props\">🧹 Erase non-html attributes when spreading props</h3><p>Let's take a look at a quick example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const MainTitle = ({ isBold, children, ...restProps }) =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;h1 \n      style={{ fontWeight: isBold ? 600 : 400 }}\n      {...restProps}\n    &gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/h1&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><p>We've just created a component that will render a h1 tag, extracted some props, and spread out all other potential props on the h1 tag. So far, so good.</p><p>Now, we're able to use it in other components and can trigger manually if the h1 should be bold or not:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// WITH BOLD TITLE\nconst IndexPage = () =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;MainTitle isBold&gt;\n        Welcome to our new site!\n      &lt;/MainTitle&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// WITHOUT BOLD TITLE\nconst AboutPage = () =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;MainTitle&gt;\n      \tSome quick lines about us!\n      &lt;/MainTitle&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><p>Up to now, everything works perfectly without any errors or warnings. The interesting part starts now when we're using other props that are directly spread onto the h1 tag.</p><p>When you're using valid HTML attributes like id or a class, everything works without any error (remember --&gt; \"className\" will become \"class\"):</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const IndexPage = () =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;MainTitle isBold id=\"index-main-title\" className=\"align-left\"&gt;\n        Welcome to our new site!\n      &lt;/MainTitle&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><p>So all props above will be added as an attribute to the h1 because we're using <strong>{...restProps}</strong> on it. No matter what, props we are adding and NOT extracting will be added to the h1 tag. </p><p>This is great for many use cases but can be a problem at the same time:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// Page Component\nconst IndexPage = () =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;MainTitle isBold hasPadding&gt;\n        Welcome to our new site!\n      &lt;/MainTitle&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}\n\n// MainTitle Component\nconst MainTitle = ({ isBold, children, ...restProps }) =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;h1 \n      style={{ \n        fontWeight: isBold ? 600 : 400,\n        padding: restProps.hasPadding ? 16 : 0\n      }}\n      {...restProps}\n    &gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/h1&gt;\n  )\n}\n</code></pre><p>In the code above we were adding a new prop called <code>hasPadding</code> to the <code>MainTitle</code> component, that is optional. Inside the component we are not extracting it from the props and call it via <code>restProps.hasPadding</code>. </p><p>The code works, but when you open your browser you'll receive a warning that <code>hasPadding</code> is a non-HTML attribute you're trying to apply on the h1 tag. This is because of <code>{...restProps}</code> on the h1 tag and not extracting <code>hasPadding</code> like <code>isBold</code> for example.</p><p>To avoid this, always extract all non-HTML attributes from the props first, to make sure that there are only valid HTML attributes in <code>restProps</code> that you're spreading onto a JSX element. </p><p>In our example it would look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// Page Component\nconst IndexPage = () =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;MainTitle isBold hasPadding&gt;\n        Welcome to our new site!\n      &lt;/MainTitle&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}\n\n// MainTitle Component\nconst MainTitle = ({ isBold, children, hasPadding, ...restProps }) =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n    &lt;h1 \n      style={{ \n        fontWeight: isBold ? 600 : 400,\n        padding: hasPadding ? 16 : 0\n      }}\n      {...restProps}\n    &gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/h1&gt;\n  )\n}\n</code></pre><p>Many of those warnings can unnecessary flood your browser's console, which can be very nasty. Especially when you're debugging. </p><p>To get more information about this topic and some other ways to solve this, check out <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/warnings/unknown-prop.html\">this part of the React docs</a>.</p><h3 id=\"-use-snippet-extensions\">🔥 Use snippet extensions </h3><p>In Visual Studio Code, for example, there are certain extensions available that increase your productivity a lot. One type of these extensions are <strong>snippet extensions.</strong> </p><p>The great benefit about them is that you don't have to write all that boilerplate code again. Imagine you're building many new components and have to type it all out again and again:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from 'react'\n\nconst GoogleMap = () =&gt; {\n\n}\n\nexport default GoogleMap</code></pre><p>With these snippets you just have to type <strong><code>rafce</code>,<em> </em></strong>for example, hit tab and you have the same boilerplate code. It is a real time saver and makes development faster. </p><p><strong>But use them with caution!</strong> I wouldn't recommend using snippets to all developers. In my opinion, beginners shouldn't use any snippets and should type the boilerplate out by hand. When you're doing that, you'll get muscle memory which manifests the stuff you learn. </p><p>If you have done it so often that you can type it out in your sleep and it becomes boring, that's the right time to use snippets. </p><p>Here are my recommendations:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-14.55.02.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-14.55.02\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-14.55.02.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-14.55.02.png 961w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"961\" height=\"171\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.05.01.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.05.01\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.05.01.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.05.01.png 962w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"962\" height=\"167\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.06.59.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.06.59\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.06.59.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.06.59.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/02/Bildschirmfoto-2022-02-01-um-15.06.59.png 1003w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"1003\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"-write-a-fragment-when-a-div-is-not-needed\">❌ Write a fragment when a div is not needed</h3><p>A React component can only render one single HTML tag at its root. So if you'd like to render two adjacent elements, you'll get the famous error called <strong>Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag</strong>. </p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const InfoText = () =&gt; {\n\t\n  // Will throw an error\n  return (\n    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This our new page, we're glad you're are here!&lt;/p&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><p>So, what can you do? You just wrap the rendered output into a fragment, which satisfies React and doesn't render an extra HTML element in the browser. </p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const InfoText = () =&gt; {\n\t\n  return (\n  \t&lt;&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;This our new page, we're glad you're are here!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><p>Of course you could have solved this with a div tag as well. But using div after div will create something I like to call <strong>div hell </strong>in the browser where you got many deep nested div tags without any sense. </p><p>So whenever you have to use a wrapper tag in React but don't necessarily need an HTML tag, then simply use a fragment.</p><h3 id=\"-integrate-self-closing-tags-when-no-children-are-needed\">👈 Integrate self closing tags when no children are needed</h3><p>From my experience, this tip right here is often overlooked, but could make your code so much cleaner with little effort. </p><p>In React you've got the opportunity to pass children elements to a component, which are then available to the component via its children property. Those components are often called <strong>composite components.</strong></p><p>In that case you have to use an opening tag and a closing tag of course:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;NavigationBar&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Home&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;About&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Projects&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Contact&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/NavigationBar&gt;</code></pre><p>But when there are no children needed, there isn't any sense in using an opening and closing tag, right? </p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;NavigationBar&gt;&lt;/NavigationBar&gt;</code></pre><p>Instead of doing this, I recommend that you just use the component as a self closing element like the input tag in HTML, that doesn't take children as well.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&lt;NavigationBar /&gt;</code></pre><p>Looks much cleaner right away, doesn't it? </p><h3 id=\"-follow-common-naming-conventions\">✅ Follow common naming conventions</h3><p>The sense behind naming conventions is to more easily recognize what type of element you're dealing with and to have something in your code that is common in the community.</p><p>From my standpoint, there are two major naming conventions involved in React and JavaScript that you should follow:</p><h4 id=\"use-pascalcase-in-components-interfaces-or-type-aliases\">Use PascalCase in components, interfaces, or type aliases</h4><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">// React component\nconst LeftGridPanel = () =&gt; {\n  ...\n}\n\n// Typescript interface\ninterface AdminUser {\n  name: string;\n  id: number;\n  email: string;\n}\n\n// Typescript Type Alias\ntype TodoList = {\n\ttodos: string[];\n    id: number;\n    name: string;\n}\n\n</code></pre><h4 id=\"use-camelcase-for-javascript-data-types-like-variables-arrays-objects-functions-and-so-on\">Use camelCase for JavaScript data types like variables, arrays, objects, functions, and so on</h4><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const getLastDigit = () =&gt; { ... }\n\nconst userTypes = [ ... ]\n\n</code></pre><p>Naming React components in PascalCase is especially important. Because when you've got a linter configured for React, but you named the component in camelCase and you're using hooks inside it, you'll get a warning message all the time that hooks are only allowed in components. That's because the linter recognizes a React components if it's written in PascalCase or not.</p><p>This can be nasty, but is fixed quickly with sticking to the established naming conventions.</p><h3 id=\"-sanitize-your-code-to-prevent-xss-attacks\">🧨 Sanitize your code to prevent XSS Attacks</h3><p>Maybe you've found yourself in a scenario where you have to use the property <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code><strong> </strong>on an element in React. Basically it's React's equivalent to <code>innerHTML</code> you might know from Javascript.</p><p>So using it, you can set HTML directly from React. </p><p>Let's consider the following example, where we'd like to render an HTML string inside a div. The string could come from a rich text editor where it's already formatted HTML.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const Markup = () =&gt; {\n  const htmlString = \"&lt;p&gt;This is set via dangerouslySetInnerHTML&lt;/p&gt;\"\n  \n  return (\n    &lt;div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: htmlString }} /&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre><p>The term <strong>dangerously </strong>is chosen with intention. Using this property can open you up to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack. So it's mandatory that the code that gets set is sanitized first. </p><p>A great library is <strong><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify\">dompurify</a></strong> that can help you out with this.</p><h2 id=\"final-words\">Final words</h2><p>Wow, that was fun right?

Your body can only work with the nutrients you are eating. If the input is bad, you can’t expect a great output, right?</p><p>A race car, for example, doesn’t take in water. It’s fueled up the gas that helps that car work as efficiently as possible. The same goes for yourself. If you want to perform better and work more efficiently, you have to put the right things in your body.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-healthy-food\">What is healthy food?</h3><p>But what does it actually mean to eat “healthier”? I’ve learned a lot about good nutrition over the last two years, and I've tried out many methods myself. When I started eating right, I felt a huge improvement in my life and my work as a programmer. </p><p>I’m not a nutritionist, but you can consider the following advice as tips from my own experience and knowledge.</p><ul><li>Decrease your sugar intake </li><li>Drink water instead of soda</li><li>Eat just a small amount of sweets per day</li><li>When eating fruits, focus more on low-sugar fruits like berries, kiwi, apricot or coconut (and many more)</li><li>Take sweetener alternatives like Erythrit</li><li>Follow a balanced diet</li><li>Eat whole grains like brown rice, buckwheat, quinoa, bulgur, millet and oats (complex carbohydrates)</li><li>Get plenty of legumes like lentils, kidney beans, green peas, chickpeas and soybeans</li><li>Go for healthy nuts like almonds, pistachios, walnuts, cashews and peanuts</li><li>Eat lots of vegetables (preferably cruciferous vegetables) like broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, cauliflower and turnips</li><li>Eat seeds like chia seeds, hemp seeds, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds (they're great on top of your dishes)</li><li>Get your “healthy” fats from fish, algae, and the nuts/seeds mentioned above</li><li>Minimize your meat intake to around 70g per day (I’d suggest to do your own further research on it because I don’t eat meat)</li><li>Eat the most carbohydrates in the morning</li><li>Your lightest meal should be at least three hours before you go to sleep</li></ul><p>There are many different diets out there and most of them are completely useless in my opinion, since they just seem to try to pull money out of your pocket. </p><p>You don’t have to turn vegan like I did, but from my research and talks to doctors, following a mediterranean diet is what’s recommended most of the time. You can <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan#the-basics\">read more about it in this article</a>.</p><p>If you really want to get serious about it, I’d suggest that you book an appointment with a nutritionist or any other professional in that field. They can help you set up your meal plans and advise you on how to make healthy choices.</p><h2 id=\"habit-2-do-plenty-of-physical-activity-and-stretching\">Habit #2 – Do Plenty of Physical Activity and Stretching</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/alora-griffiths-WX7FSaiYxK8-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"alora-griffiths-WX7FSaiYxK8-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/alora-griffiths-WX7FSaiYxK8-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/alora-griffiths-WX7FSaiYxK8-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/alora-griffiths-WX7FSaiYxK8-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2021/04/alora-griffiths-WX7FSaiYxK8-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@aloragriffiths?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Alora Griffiths</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/sport?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>We all know it. As programmers we might sit for 8 to 10 hours a day which causes our backs to ache and generally can make us feel unbalanced. </p><p>Physical activity like running, working out with weights, or doing some form of sports will not only improve our physical health but our mental health as well. </p><h3 id=\"why-is-physical-activity-important\">Why is physical activity important?</h3><p>Being physically active is one of the most important factors that helps me perform on a high level as a programmer. It helps relieve stress, clears my mind, and strengthens my body. </p><p>Physical activity also helps protect you against many chronic diseases and improves your brain function – which is of course very important as a programmer. </p><p>Another great benefit is that it can help you control your weight. So when following a healthier diet and being physically active on a regular basis, you less likely to worry about your weight.</p><p>I love to run in the morning on an empty stomach because it gets my blood running and sets my energy for the day. It can be hard, especially when I don’t feel like it – but once I'm done, I know that I’ve already conquered the hardest part of the day right at the beginning. </p><p>This forms a strong mindset and loads me with energy. It’s also very beneficial because your body takes the energy it needs from your fat reserves which leads to fat burning.</p><h3 id=\"why-stretching-matters-too\">Why stretching matters, too</h3><p>Doing regular physical activity is great, but it's only half of the picture. The other half is all about stretching your body. </p><p>Stretching helps you improve your flexibility and posture. It also helps ease your pain after sitting all day in front of a computer. Varying your working position from sitting to standing is also a great way to move your body in different ways.</p><p>Stretching can also be very beneficial to other areas of your life. It releases tension and therefore reduces your stress levels. It also helps you calm your mind and increase your energy. </p><p>Don’t skip the stretching in the morning or in the evening. Your body and your mind will thank you. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2SOrScNbww\">This video</a> used to help me out a lot.</p><h2 id=\"habit-3-develop-proper-stress-management-techniques\">Habit #3 – Develop Proper Stress Management Techniques</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/hans-vivek-UiMkBvDQSAA-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"hans-vivek-UiMkBvDQSAA-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/hans-vivek-UiMkBvDQSAA-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/hans-vivek-UiMkBvDQSAA-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/hans-vivek-UiMkBvDQSAA-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2021/04/hans-vivek-UiMkBvDQSAA-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1330\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@oneshotespresso?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Hans Vivek</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/meditation?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Our lives as developers can be very hectic and stressful. So it’s very important that we integrate at least one way of relieving stress into our routines. </p><p>As we’ve seen above, being physically active and stretching daily can help us relieve a lot of stress. But there are more ways you should consider.</p><h3 id=\"good-stress-vs-bad-stress\">Good stress vs bad stress</h3><p>But is stress bad in general? Basically it’s a warning system which produces the fight-or-flight response. There are both beneficial and harmful parts about it. </p><p>In small doses, stress can help you meet daily challenges and motivate yourself to reach your goals. It can also boost your memory and can help you to accomplish tasks more efficiently.</p><p>Too much stress, on the other hand, can cause serious health issues. It can weaken your immune system and can cause high blood pressure, depression, and anxiety. </p><p>Some of the most important signals of too much stress are an inability to concentrate, body aches, headaches, appetite changes and getting sick more often. Another very common signal is if you can’t sleep properly anymore and can't turn your mind off.</p><p>In my opinion, this bad stress isn’t something you have, it’s something you create for yourself. It’s always a sign that you are thinking about the future and feel anxious about it. Maybe you can’t meet a deadline or you’re thinking about what your boss will do when you’re doing a “bad” job. You feel your heart beating and it begins to take over you. </p><h3 id=\"how-to-manage-your-stress\">How to manage your stress</h3><p>Breathing exercises are one of the best ways to calm your mind, to relieve stress, and help you to be more aware of yourself. </p><p>In stressful situations we begin to breath faster which will cause stress in our body. There’s also a thing called screen apnea which means we tend to stop breathing when looking at our screens. You can imagine that this can't be healthy at all! </p><p>With breathing exercises you can train yourself to breathe slowly even in stressful situations. Compare it with a cup of tea. Every day you’re filling up the cup with stressful or hectic situations. With relaxing breathing exercises like meditation, tai-chi, qi-gong or diaphragmatic breathing you empty the cup again. </p><p>Imagine what happens with the cup and with yourself when you don’t empty it every day and pour more and more tea into it. </p><p>If you don’t have any experience with meditation and the like, I can highly recommend that you start with an app like “headspace” or “calm”. They offer guided meditations that are very friendly for beginners. You can also visit a tai-chi group in your area or join a meditation group. </p><p>These practices don’t only help you relieve stress, they also train you to be more in the moment and to control your thoughts. You will learn to let the thoughts come and go. And it'll feel like 500 pounds has fallen off your shoulders. You'll also improve your ability to concentrate even better at your job.</p><h2 id=\"habit-4-maintain-a-beginner-s-mindset\">Habit #4 – Maintain a Beginner’s Mindset</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/brett-jordan-E1por_SGvJE-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"brett-jordan-E1por_SGvJE-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/brett-jordan-E1por_SGvJE-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/brett-jordan-E1por_SGvJE-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/brett-jordan-E1por_SGvJE-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2021/04/brett-jordan-E1por_SGvJE-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Brett Jordan</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/start?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Do you remember the first time you wrote code or explored the universe of computer science? Can you still feel that excitement that kicked in? </p><h3 id=\"think-back-to-the-beginning\">Think back to the beginning</h3><p>I can still remember how I felt and what it did to me when I discovered coding. It was like tapping into a top secret. Computer Science and especially programming was like magic for me. Those people who were able to write code were like superheroes from my perspective. </p><p>Once I took my first steps in writing code myself, I remember feeling like “Holy crap, this will be my thing”. I wanted to learn it all, even though I knew that wasn't possible. </p><p>I knew that I was still at the beginning of my journey and I was really open to learning a lot of different things. It was okay for me to not be good at it, but I knew the more I sat down and learned, the better I would become. </p><p>I accepted my beginner level and the more I learned, the more I recognized how much I wanted to learn.</p><h3 id=\"be-a-beginner-again\">Be a beginner again</h3><p>That’s what I consider to be a <em>beginner's mindset</em>. Looking through the eyes of a beginner who seeks out new stuff to learn and accepts that there is still a ton out there to learn. They still have this excitement to explore more and more. </p><p>Maintaining this mindset and recognizing that mistakes are opportunities to learn new skills is key to progress as a developer. Don’t shy away from new challenges, even if you have twenty years of experience. </p><h2 id=\"habit-5-get-enough-sleep-and-take-breaks\">Habit #5 – Get Enough Sleep and Take Breaks</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/adi-goldstein-yVdN3xagPQk-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"adi-goldstein-yVdN3xagPQk-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/adi-goldstein-yVdN3xagPQk-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/adi-goldstein-yVdN3xagPQk-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/adi-goldstein-yVdN3xagPQk-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/adi-goldstein-yVdN3xagPQk-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@adigold1?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Adi Goldstein</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/sleeping-man?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Taking breaks and making sure to get enough sleep are probably two of the most important factors to help you perform consistently at a high level.</p><p>Like batteries, our body and mind need to rest properly to recharge. Since programming can be intense and mentally taxing, taking breaks and sleeping enough is even more important.</p><p>Of course, I’m not a doctor or an expert in the medical field. But I love to share with you what I've found and what I've experienced while experimenting with my sleep routine. If you’ve got serious issues with your sleep and health, think about consulting an expert.</p><h3 id=\"the-negative-effects-of-not-enough-sleep\">The negative effects of not enough sleep</h3><p>There are many negative effects on our bodies when we don’t sleep enough. It can lead to memory issues because during sleep our brain forms connections that help us process and remember new information. </p><p>One of our most important skills is also in danger when we don't sleep enough. We can develop trouble thinking and concentrating. When we don’t get enough rest our problem-solving skills and concentration are negatively affected. So pulling all-nighter after all-nighter might seem efficient first, but can really damage your long term programming skills.</p><p>There are many other negative effects like mood changes, weakened immunity, high blood pressure, risk for diabetes, weight gain, risk of heart disease and a low sex drive. Sleep is as essential as water and air for our bodies. </p><h3 id=\"how-much-sleep-is-enough\">How much sleep is enough?</h3><p>But what exactly does enough sleep mean? There are different opinions about that topic and I’d suggest finding your own sweet spot. You can test different amounts like six, seven, or eight hours and track your energy levels during your day.</p><p>My own sweet spot is in between seven and eight hours. Sleeping less than seven hours sometimes is okay for me but over a longer time I feel that my energy levels go down. On the other side when I sleep more than eight hours it’s also not beneficial for my energy levels after some time.</p><p>There are some tricks to help you establish a healthy sleep routine, like avoiding daytime naps, not drinking caffeine a few hours prior to bedtime, going to bed and waking up at the same time (even on weekends!), doing relaxing activities an hour before going to bed like mediations, and not using electronic devices before sleep. </p><h3 id=\"why-taking-breaks-is-important\">Why taking breaks is important</h3><p>The same goes for taking breaks during your work time. I normally take a quick break once I get the feeling that I can’t concentrate properly anymore. </p><p>The break doesn’t have to be huge. Throwing some darts on my dart board, going for a quick walk with the dog, running for 30 minutes or just standing up, having a good stretch, and making new coffee or tea are some chances to get a little break. </p><p>Most of the time I find the solutions for problems I was thinking about for one hour straight during those breaks. Taking me out of that “black hole” does wonders. </p><p>Some productivity systems like the pomodoro technique can also help you to establish a routine of taking breaks. You can set a timer for twenty minutes where you’re doing concentrated work, and after that you take a five minute break. That’s one pomodoro. After three or four pomodoros you take a longer break of thirty minutes. </p><p>But you can just set up a timer to remind you every hour to take a break of around ten minutes, for example. As always, try different things out and stick to what works best for you.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-form-habits\">How to Form Habits</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/aman-upadhyay-JAgokV30kGk-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"aman-upadhyay-JAgokV30kGk-unsplash\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/aman-upadhyay-JAgokV30kGk-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/aman-upadhyay-JAgokV30kGk-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/aman-upadhyay-JAgokV30kGk-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2021/04/aman-upadhyay-JAgokV30kGk-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2500\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@iaman_upadhyay?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Aman Upadhyay</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/motivation?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>If you want to learn more about building habits that last forever, I highly encourage you to read “Atomic Habits” from James Clear. If you’ve already read it and are still struggling with building your habits, read it again. He basically structures the process of successfully building habits into four laws. </p><h3 id=\"habit-forming-law-1-make-it-obvious\">Habit forming law #1 – Make it obvious</h3><p>The first law is to make it obvious. Point out triggers that remind or force you to do the new habit. </p><p>For example if you want to work out in the morning, pack your bag the evening before and place it along with your outfit at your door. The first thing that you see in the morning is your stuff for working out. </p><h3 id=\"habit-forming-law-2-make-it-attractive\">Habit forming law #2 – Make it attractive</h3><p>The second law is to make it attractive. Combine a habit you HAVE to do (your new habit, like running) with a habit that you LIKE to do (an already existing habit, like listening to your favorite music). </p><p>Another way is to search for an environment where your new habit is normal. This could be a local running club for example.</p><h3 id=\"habit-forming-law-3-make-it-easy\">Habit forming law #3 – Make it easy</h3><p>The third law is to make it easy. We often tend to expect too much of ourselves, especially at the beginning. There is no such thing as an overnight sensation when building habits – they are all formed over time. </p><p>The first 60 days are the most important when you're trying to form a habit, and it is established by doing it consistently. So, make it as easy as possible for you. </p><p>Cut all the obstacles that may get in your way of doing the habit. For example, if you want to cook your own healthy food, make sure that your kitchen is clean. Because cleaning it up before cooking your food can get in your way, drain your motivation, and lead to you not cooking at all.</p><p>A key factor for making it as easy as possible is to follow the two-minute-rule. Do actions that don’t take longer than two minutes. </p><p>For example you want to read more and your ultimate goal is to read one book a week, start with one page a day. Remember to first establish the habit and then optimize it. This is essential for getting used to the new habit. </p><h3 id=\"habit-forming-law-4-make-it-rewarding\">Habit forming law #4 – Make it rewarding</h3><p>The fourth law is about making it rewarding. After you’ve done your new habit, reward and cheer yourself on. A very common practice is to have a list or calendar and every time you’ve done the thing, you cross another day off. </p><p>You can also transfer this process into a habit tracker where you really can see your progress. You won't want to end the streak of consistently doing it. Like in law #3, remember to focus on consistency over quality. What’s been rewarded will be repeated and what’s punished will be avoided. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-get-rid-of-bad-habits\">How to get rid of bad habits</h2><p>If you want to get rid of bad habits, you can reverse those laws. Let’s say you want to cut down your time watching TV. Make it harder for yourself to turn it on by unplugging it, hiding your remote control in your basement, or by putting the tv completely away. </p><p>Or when you slip up and perform a bad habit, burn $50 or anything else that really punishes you. <br><br>Are there any habits you definitely have to get better at? Or are there habits I forgot to mention? </p><p>Just message me on my instagram account <strong>@jean_marc.dev<em>.</em></strong> I’m very excited to receive your answers!</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

My main job was to test new and old electrical devices and check if they were secure. I had a measuring device which checked if the insulation and the resistance of the ground were good. </p><p>There were days where I spent my time testing around 100 devices. Day in and day out. Every time the same motion. Unplug the old device, grab the new one, plug it in, scan the barcode and start the test by clicking the same buttons. Then start again….</p><p>My tasks alternated a bit and I was sometimes able to do something different on some days. I had to focus on solving electrical problems, repair circuit issues inside houses and build new installations. Those were the fun parts of my job. </p><p>I loved to solve problems. It gave me headaches at first, but once I got through them it was a great feeling. I felt like Sherlock Holmes hunting electrical problems instead of criminals. </p><p>The joy of putting in the work to create something new was also very appealing to me. When I saw what I’d accomplished that day I was happy with my efforts.</p><blockquote>“So why did you decide to switch careers, bro?” </blockquote><p>There were many significant drawbacks for me working as an Electrician.<br></p><ol><li>Working on construction sites wasn’t for me anymore</li><li>I was always striving for more and was around people who were complaining all day but didn’t do anything about their situation</li><li>It was easier for me to work with my head than with my hands</li><li>I felt that I was determined to do more than testing devices and hitting construction sites</li><li>The money wasn’t great</li><li>All in all, I was unchallenged day by day and that made me tired of working as an Electrician</li></ol><p>For the last three years I tested different things, trying to build my own business to quit my job. I faced a lot of challenges and learned a ton about myself and what I’m capable of. </p><p>So I tried affiliate marketing, ECommerce, dropshipping, social media marketing and health coaching. Unfortunately none of them worked out due to many factors. The most important factor was that I gave up as soon as the excitement from the beginning faded away. </p><p>I thought that I always need to have fun doing my job and didn’t consider that the process of building a business is like a rollercoaster, and is not linear. There are days or maybe weeks where I didn't feel like it and there were times where I was in the flow. But unfortunately I didn’t realize it back then. </p><p>So I jumped right to the next topic and experienced the same over and over again. At the beginning there always was excitement, but once it faded away procrastination kicked in and I lost my joy. I didn’t have the mentality to push through those times.</p><h2 id=\"my-first-lines-of-code\">My First Lines of Code</h2><p>During these three years I stumbled across SaaS (Software as a Service) and thought it was worth checking out. To be honest, when I tried out different businesses the fun part for me was the initial technical setup. I thought it could be the best business for me because it involved a lot of technical stuff. </p><p>But wait, would I have to code it by myself?</p><p>Of course, I knew I could pay others to build it but I didn’t have the money. Computer Science was always a subject I hated in school because it seemed pretty boring. But I always had huge respect for those who knew how to code and could interact with a computer on a very deep level. </p><p>I thought that I had to be a computer genius to be capable of doing something similar. This is a huge trap many self-taught developers fall into.</p><p>I didn’t have a specific idea for the SaaS in mind and decided to take a look at coding. So I jumped on YouTube and searched for beginner tutorials. This was around February 2018 and I saw a lot of videos were about Python. </p><p>The first tutorial I’ve ever watched was from Coding Dojo about the basics of Python like declaring variables, if / else statements, loops and functions. </p><p>I was sitting there, my jaw dropped and I felt so much excitement that this stuff wasn’t too hard to understand. Slowly the misconception that I had to be a computer genius faded away. </p><p>So I spent the whole day watching Python tutorials and was happy to get to know more and more. Learning new things has always been a great joy for me.</p><p>On the next day I searched for resources where I could learn to code online. I came across Udacity and Codecademy. </p><p>On Udacity was a free course called “Intro to Computer Science” where we built a search engine with Python. At the beginning I could follow along pretty well but the more we advanced the harder it got for me. Then I recognized that coding wasn’t always as easy as I thought. But I pushed through and was happy that I could finish the course. </p><p>I really liked Python because it had an easy syntax and helped me to learn the core concepts of programming like functions, loops, variables, conditionals, data mutation and many more. </p><p>After that I felt the urge to learn more about the basics and started a Python Course on Codecademy that was a lot of fun as well. I really enjoyed the different tasks and could write my code directly in the browser. </p><p>There was one thing left I wasn’t very clear about:</p><p>“What should I do with Python and what are my goals?” </p><p>I couldn’t answer this question and searched again. Immediately I came across topics like Data Science, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Ethical Hacking, Web Development and Neuronal Networks. Pretty heavy stuff but I was really interested in... in all of it.</p><p>So I started with Data Science and Data Visualization. I felt pretty confident with all the tutorials I went through, but got hit right in the face. Why? I was only experienced in doing tutorials and not creating my own projects. </p><p>That’s another pitfall many beginners fall into. The real learning happens when you’re doing your own projects and have to find ways to solve your own problems. But back then I didn’t consider building my own projects. </p><p><strong>I didn't have any clue what I should build. </strong>So I spent my time doing exercises on “Project Euler” and thought that I would sharpen my coding skills with that approach. It actually worked out but I couldn’t imagine doing this my whole life. I thought about other opportunities like Web Development but they didn’t appeal to me. </p><p>Another thing that overwhelmed me was deciding on a career path - should I choose freelancing, finding a job, studying Computer Science (many job postings for Data Science required a degree) or a new apprenticeship?</p><p>The excitement from the beginning started to fade away again and I began to think “Programming isn’t for me…” </p><p>After 3 months of learning Python I left programming being completely overwhelmed.</p><h2 id=\"getting-to-know-myself-and-forming-a-strong-mindset\">Getting to Know Myself and Forming a Strong Mindset</h2><p>After trying out programming I took a break from all that business and programming stuff. I focused on my life, my martial arts training and my health. During that time I turned vegan and it had a huge impact on my mental and physical health. That was around November 2018. </p><p>The situation didn’t change for me. I still worked as an Electrician and the deep drive to accomplish great things was there as well. I took the time to recap the last three years and recognized the factors that caused me to fail. <br></p><ol><li><strong>I gave up once it became uncomfortable</strong></li><li><strong>I had no clear goal in mind</strong></li><li><strong>My mindset was poor</strong></li><li><strong>I felt I didn’t deserve success</strong></li><li><strong>I was stuck in my comfort zone</strong></li><li><strong>I made many excuses why it didn’t work out</strong></li><li><strong>I wasn’t able to take responsibility for my life</strong></li></ol><p>After getting clear about these things I started to think about my next steps. I knew that I had to get my mindset right first. </p><p>I started to work with a well-known coach here in Germany. The coaching cost me quite a lot of money (between 6,000 and 8,000€) and I took a loan from my bank because this time I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone. </p><p>I really wanted to change something and the debt always made me realize this. But generally, I wouldn’t suggest you put yourself in debt. For me, it was the best way at this time to get my little butt out of my comfort zone.</p><p>We began to set a foundation and he taught me principles to become successful. So the first weeks were about becoming clear about my goals, tools to manage my state, and developing a strong business mindset. He pushed me out of my comfort zone day by day by speaking in front of the camera, doing live-videos, closing high ticket sales and so much more.</p><p>I’m really thankful that I had the opportunity to work with him! </p><p>During these three months I also got to know myself even better, and I learned what I was capable of. I recognized that I’m a very analytical person and love to build things with logic. </p><h2 id=\"learning-web-development\">Learning Web Development</h2><p>At the end of my coaching, I had matured a lot but still didn’t know what I should do. But I knew that it had to be something with logic and building things. </p><p>During that time my girlfriend got a new job as a personal assistant at an agency that built websites for customers. She could work from home mostly, a goal I tried to reach the last three years with my own business. I asked her what they are doing there and she told me “they are coding websites and do the online marketing, that’s all I know”.</p><p>Wow, that hit me again. I thought about the time one year ago when I learned coding with Python. So I hopped on the internet and searched for web development and came across HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This was a whole new space for me that I wasn’t interested in last year. I realized if I had continued my coding journey one year ago I could be somewhere else at that time. </p><p>It was the last day of March 2019 and my girlfriend was going to bed, but I decided to stay up a bit. I went to Codecademy again because I had good memories of the Python course. </p><p>That evening I started with an introduction to HTML5. I began to write my first tags like &lt;ul&gt; , &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; and got the feedback right away. Seeing how the things I typed in looked in the browser was a joy I’d never thought of!</p><p><strong>In other words, I was hooked right away. </strong>Immediately I knew that this was the craft I wanted to learn and build great things with. So I continued with the HTML5 course until I nearly fell asleep on my keyboard.</p><p>The next day, I woke up and felt very happy to learn that superpower of coding again. But this time I would make sure that things were different than last year. For example, I would focus on building my own projects as well and having a clear goal in mind. </p><p>With a refreshed mindset I knew that this wouldn’t be easy but I got used to working while others were sleeping or partying. I set the goal of getting a job during the following 365 days. </p><h2 id=\"a-new-passion-was-born\">A New Passion Was Born</h2><p>On April 1st, 2019 I made the commitment to code every day at least two hours until I reached my goal. I was active on Instagram during that time on my private account and searched for other coders. To be honest I never ever thought that there was such a big and great community of programmers! </p><p>I saw that there were a lot of self-taught developers who were killing it! Today I’m pretty thankful that I searched on Instagram for them. I also came across some of them who were doing a 100DaysOfCodeChallange. “That would be a great start” I thought.</p><p>A few hours later I created a new Instagram account dedicated to my coding journey. I wrote the first post where I defined my goal and provided a brief introduction to myself. It turned out to be the best thing to hold myself accountable. On one of the following days, I started the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.</p><p>Fueled with that new passion I continued learning HTML5 and CSS3 on Codecademy until I finished both courses and became pretty confident with my skills. </p><p>I had heard a lot about FreeCodeCamp, so I visited their website and saw that they offered certificates for different paths. I realized that this would be a great way to get some practical experience and to reward myself with that certificate. </p><p>So I took the Responsive Web Design path, completed all projects, and finally received the certificate that still hangs up on my wall. That was around May 2019. </p><p><strong>Documenting my journey on Instagram and writing about my daily progress, drawbacks, and obstacles was a great way to hold myself accountable. </strong>The benefit that came along with that was that I slowly began to inspire others and I got to know many great developers. </p><p>After spending two straight months digging deep into HTML and CSS (with SCSS) I felt the urge to come up with a plan for my next topics. This was because I knew from my time learning Python that I could become overwhelmed with all that technology. </p><p>So I had to trim this overload on potential topics to the ones that were necessary for landing a front end developer job. That’s the power of having a goal in mind. You know where you want to go and you’ll automatically form your actions to get there.</p><p><strong>I came up with my own syllabus doing three things:<br></strong></p><ol><li><strong>I found a frontend roadmap on hackernoon</strong></li><li><strong>I looked up job postings and saw the requirements for a junior developer</strong></li><li><strong>I asked other experienced developers (thanks to Instagram) who were working in that industry</strong></li></ol><p>With the help of that syllabus, I was able to cover all the important topics to land my junior developer job. A great benefit was that I was unlikely to feel overwhelmed and stuck during my journey because I had something to hold on to. </p><p>Of course, I edited the syllabus over the time and changed some details but the outline was there and that’s what kept me going.</p><p>After building some fake websites for myself with HTML and SCSS I finally began to learn JavaScript in July 2019. </p><p>To be honest, HTML and CSS are pretty straightforward to learn, especially when you’re a beginner. JavaScript on the other hand, takes time and gave me a lot of headaches (and it still does :-D). </p><p>I already knew the core concepts like functions, variables, loops, conditional statements, and data structures like objects, strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays from my time learning Python. So those things weren’t a big surprise for me. But with Python, I only scratched the surface on those topics. </p><h2 id=\"learning-real-programming\">Learning \"Real\" Programming</h2><p>In the beginning, I was very frustrated because I had to think in a completely different way than I was used to. I knew that was the point where my comfort zone ended and I had to push through those barriers. I also reminded myself that this had always been the point over the last years where I had quit. But this time I didn’t feel like quitting at all. </p><p>I enjoyed all the courses by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy and with the help of his JavaScript course I built a solid foundation. </p><p>The first project I built on my own was “Rock Paper Scissors” which took me about a week to finish. It was tough but I could reinforce the learnings from that course like DOM Manipulation and interacting with user inputs. </p><p>After I had finished it I continued with the next topics, then stopped for a while and built my own project with the newly acquired knowledge.</p><p>This pattern became pretty common along my coding journey.<strong> I took a course, learned new things, stopped for a while to build my own project based on the learned skills and continued with the course. </strong>It turned out to be the most efficient way for me to really learn coding. </p><p>I also built a decision app, a todo list, an app called “what should I eat” and a little eCommerce site with filtering products. It was all written in Vanilla JavaScript because I really wanted to learn and understand the language first before I hopped into frameworks and libraries. </p><p>The hardest project to date was the little eCommerce site with those filters. It took me about three weeks and I often had doubts if programming really was for me. But once I fought through these barriers and gave everything I had to solve the problem I experienced a high feeling that kept me going for hours. That’s the reason why there were many days and nights where I sat there and typed like crazy. </p><p>After three months of dedicated hustle with Vanilla JavaScript, I got to know a CTO of an eCommerce agency. Where? You guessed it, on Instagram. I had followed him for quite a while and was really impressed by his work ethic. He asked me if I would like to do an internship at this company. I was blown away and felt scared at the same time. </p><p>I knew that this was the ultimate way to expand my comfort zone tremendously. So I didn’t hesitate to accept his offer. </p><h2 id=\"my-first-steps-as-a-real-world-web-developer\">My First Steps as a Real World Web Developer</h2><p>I had never thought of doing something like this after 6 months of learning web development. Normally I don’t believe in pure coincidences. Today I think my actions of being present on Instagram and focusing my actions towards my goal made this coincidence more likely to happen. </p><p>We arranged a two-week internship in October 2019. The agency was a two-hour drive away from my location and I thought it would be the best idea to book an AirBnB there. I was still working as an Electrician and I worked overtime to be able to take a week off from my extra hours. I took the other week off from my holidays. So the foundation for that internship was set up. </p><p>It was a huge push out of my comfort zone to leave my comfortable apartment and my girlfriend<strong> but I knew that it was important for my growth as a developer and as a human being. </strong>So I pushed through the resistance and got myself on the way. </p><p>I don’t know the last time I felt as nervous as on the first day before I entered the agency. From the past, I knew that the situations that made me feel anxious and nervous are the ones that were the most important. So there was no other way around. Let’s jump right into it! </p><p>The internship was amazing. I met likeminded people with strong work ethics, encountered many challenges and was pushed out of my comfort zone every day. There were evenings where I couldn’t talk properly anymore, but I liked it because I gave it my all. </p><p>As a highlight at the end of it, the CEO and CTO took me out for dinner and told me that they could imagine hiring me in the future. I was surprised and felt grateful for that opportunity. Especially because I had never thought of this happening that quick. </p><p>I learned a lot during these two weeks. After the internship, I got used to writing and read more complex code, working up to ten hours a day as a developer. Chrome developer tools became second nature and I saw what I was able to learn in two weeks. </p><p>Even up 'til today I’m still very thankful for that opportunity and for all the people I met there!</p><h2 id=\"getting-closer-to-my-goal\">Getting Closer to My Goal</h2><p>The internship had a huge impact and I recognized that working as a full time developer was the right thing for me. So I started to progress with my syllabus and I wanted to do another internship at a different company in January 2020. </p><p>In November 2019 I began to learn more advanced stuff in JavaScript like Closures, AJAX, ES6 features, IIFEE’s, Higher-Order Functions and many more. I also learned jQuery, basic webpack, git and npm. </p><p>I decided that my next project should involve an API because I loved to communicate with the back end. It was about a cocktail app fetching an API from a cocktail database. I spent the whole of November on planning, designing and coding it. </p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong>:</p><p>Getting into UI / UX design was part of my syllabus as well but the main focus was on programming. So I began learning it slowly in Adobe XD. </p><p>The reason for learning it was to understand the concepts of good web design and to make my projects look better. I still enjoy it although I’m not the most creative person out there. I feel a lot happier when I can come up with my own design and code it. </p><p>It’s also a great balance to activate both parts of my brain (the creative and the analytical). In my opinion, grasping at least the basics of web design is an essential skill for any frontend developer. </p><p>Back to my cocktail app - This project was the biggest one I had ever done and it was the most challenging. I tried to implement the MVC architecture and use the latest topics like AJAX, ES6 classes and webpack. There were many challenges where I had to mutate the data from that API. It wasn’t easy, but it made me a better developer. </p><p>The user could search for a specific cocktail or ingredient, get related drinks or ingredients based on their search result, add cocktails to a favorites list (and delete them) and receive a randomly generated cocktail out of the whole database. </p><p>After finishing this bad boy I was pretty happy that I had the guts to accomplish it. <strong>Cheering myself for every accomplishment along the way is still an essential part to stay motivated</strong>. It doesn’t matter if it’s a tiny thing or a bigger concept. As long as I make sure to move forward every day I’m reaching my goal sooner or later. </p><h2 id=\"hitting-the-first-plateau\">Hitting the First Plateau</h2><p>To end a great and intense 2019 I learned bootstrap, cloned a few templates and was busy setting my top five goals for 2020. Number one was getting that developer job by July 1st. I also used the Christmas holidays to take a step away from coding and wanted to start 2020 with a big bang.</p><p>I also contacted around 30 companies in my local area for the planned internship in January or February. I had a few meetings with them but none of them worked out. </p><p>But this wasn’t discouraging for me at all because the reasons didn't have much to do with me. A common reason was that most companies don’t offer just a two-week internship. They offer at least three months. So I skipped the idea of doing an internship and focused more on the syllabus to land that job.</p><p>The next big topic on my plate was to learn a JavaScript Framework. I didn’t know if I’d go for Vue, Angular or React. I had a lot of talks with other developers and many of them said that Vue was very great. So I started to learn Vue.js in order to build better web applications and to become a more skilled developer. </p><p>To be honest, I didn’t Vue at the beginning because it taught me a completely different way to think about writing JavaScript code. But here the cycle of getting comfortable with the uncomfortable began again. “Business as usual”.</p><p>To compare Vue with other frameworks I did a few introduction tutorials on React and had to admit that I liked it much more. It was a little bit more abstract than Vue but I loved it right away. So I went over the basics of React and felt confused quite often (here we are again :-D).</p><p>But once I learned how to think in React (a skill that everybody has to learn first) I had an epiphany. </p><p>In the past, I had covered the fundamentals, built one or two projects and then moved on with my syllabus. The only exception was JavaScript but I didn’t spend much time on really learning the advanced concepts.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>The epiphany was that right then I was on a plateau of being a good beginner and I was about to progress to become more professional. </strong></p><p>Just scratching the surface was not enough if I wanted to progress. So I committed myself to concentrating deeply on React to become really really good at it. I would rather be very good at a few things instead of okay at many things. </p><p>This was the main thing for me to focus on in order to cross the next bridge in my developer career. The beautiful thing about programming <strong>is that there never is an end where you can say “Okey folks, now I’ve learned it all…”</strong> There is always more to learn, even with languages or frameworks you’ve worked with over the last 20 years. </p><p>So I knew that there wouldn't be a point where I’d master React but coming very close remains my goal.</p><h2 id=\"building-stuff-with-react\">Building Stuff with React</h2><p>I searched for a good React course on Udemy and stumbled across the one by Andrew Mead. I had never heard of him but the rating of the course was very good. So I started learning React on a deeper scale.</p><p>The first thing I loved was the way Andrew teaches. He transfers his passion and has a talent to explain complex things in a simple way bit by bit. There are also many coding challenges along the way that force you to think on your own. I don’t think that I’d be so confident with React without taking this course. Thank you Andrew!</p><p>But just coding along with the course and doing coding challenges was not enough. So I began to create a little project every week. In January and February, I came up with a to-do list, a tip calculator, a formula calculator for electrical engineering (basic stuff) and a new version of my decision app. </p><p>The more I progressed in React the more I began to love it. I also enjoyed learning how to test with Jest and Enzyme and to implement a database like Firebase that made my apps more complex and dynamic. </p><p>A big topic (and one of the hardest about React at least for me) is global state management. There are many ways to implement global state but one of the most well-known is by using Redux. </p><p>I hated it at the beginning because I didn’t see the benefits of it by setting up all the boilerplate before actually using it. I was confused by all the new things like action generators, reducers, store, dispatch and the whole new architecture. </p><p><strong>But my experience told me that this was a sign to learn a lot of new things and to become a more skilled developer</strong>. So there was no other way around for me than to learn it. I took some basic tutorials on YouTube and slowly began to really understand how it’s used and why. </p><p>Pushing through that wall and finally understanding difficult things gave me a great feeling. This won’t change in the future. I realize that it isn’t as tremendously difficult as I had thought before. That’s what I usually keep in mind when I encounter difficult tasks and find ways to understand it. </p><h2 id=\"the-best-things-come-when-you-least-expect\">The Best Things Come When You Least Expect</h2><p>I had a plan for that first half of 2020 to land a job. I wanted to create more projects, a great website, prepare for job interviews and to reach out to fifty companies in my local area. </p><p>I had decided to decline the job offer from the agency where I had done my internship because I didn’t feel like building online shops all day and wanted to find a job in my local area without moving. But I made very cool connections and we are still doing hackathons together or chatting on Instagram. </p><p>There was still a lot of work to do and I knew that this would require more dedication than before. As I scrolled through Instagram I saw an ad by a software company. I usually receive similar ads but most of them are far away from me. So I looked at their profile and saw we were in the same city. </p><p>I checked my list of potential employers and the company wasn’t on it because I had never heard of them. Their profile and website looked cool and I wrote them a quick message saying that I like their appearance. </p><p>I shot a few messages back and forth. They were looking for a passionate developer and I was looking for a company with a modern culture and a cool environment. So we arranged a meeting where we could get to know each other.</p><p>Like the internship in October 2019, I didn’t see this coming and was blown away by the next “coincidence”. Slowly I became pretty nervous but I knew that this was the right sign again!</p><p>As I stepped into the company I immediately felt that there was a great atmosphere and was welcomed by one of the owners. We sat down and talked a lot about coding. The mood was very relaxed and I could just be myself. </p><p>It was a great pleasure to talk with someone again who shared the same passion for programming as I do. The other owner came in and began to talk as well. I liked them both and their approach to modern work. </p><p>This was always a key factor for me finding a new job. I always wanted to work in a company with flat hierarchies, modern working culture, new technologies and people around me who wanted to progress like me. It seemed that I could find those values right there. We arranged a day where I could spend the whole day and see how they work. </p><p>Funny enough, two other companies where I wanted to do an internship mailed me that they were open for a one-day work trial. I agreed on that and had three days of getting to know three different companies in one week. </p><h2 id=\"touching-my-new-job\">Touching My New Job</h2><p>Nervous and anxious again I started my first one-day work trial and one of the owners told me about their current project building an awning configurator. I was blown away by all that input but was happy that I could understand some things. They were working with React as well in the front end which I really liked. I felt the passion they put in and could relate to it. </p><p>I talked to the front end developers, the back end developers, the designers, the apprentices and looked into their work. They all were very cool human beings and gave me respect for my journey. I appreciated this a lot. </p><p>The other work trials were at another eCommerce agency and an agency who built websites and did online marketing. I also met great people there and knew I could learn a lot, too. But neither of them had what I was looking for.</p><p>So I made the decision to go for the first company I had discovered by coincidence on Instagram. I messaged one of the owners that I could imagine working there. Surprisingly he said the same and was satisfied with me. </p><p>Wow – this all had gone so quickly and relatively easily that I couldn’t have imagined it. I think one major advantage was that they could look over my Instagram feed and see that I was taking it seriously. That’s one of the reasons why I didn’t have to write an application at all. </p><p>But it wasn’t official yet. We had to arrange some paperwork like salary and that kind of stuff. This process still took another two weeks where I couldn’t sleep well because I was so damn excited. </p><p>I sent them my expectations, a quick CV and a motivational letter to give them a deeper impression. A few days passed by where my nervousness was at its peak. </p><p>I was so close to reaching that big goal of landing a developer job after one year of hard and dedicated hustle. I had worked early in the morning before work, through the nights on weekends and on evenings after work instead of spending time with my girlfriend (mostly). I had made some sacrifices along the way and concentrated my actions towards that goal. </p><p>And here I was, one year later and about to land the job without the stress of applying, getting rejected and doing job interviews. </p><h2 id=\"the-call-that-changed-everything\">The Call that Changed Everything</h2><p>A few days later after I sent out my documents I received a call. It was a Monday while I was doing my work as an Electrician. </p><p>“Have they declined my offer? Was the salary expectation too high? Did they find some else? …” went through my head.</p><p>One of the owners talked to me and told me that they could meet my expectations and would like to employ me as a front end developer in July 2020. WOW! It had finally happened and I couldn’t say much during that call. I thanked him a lot and it fell awesome that my dedication had finally paid off. </p><p>Of course there is still so much to learn and this is just the beginning of it all. I have big goals in my life with coding and the first step into that field is done.</p><p>Right now it’s April 2020 and I’m busy with sharpening my skills with React and preparing myself for that job. I’ll take a deeper look at learning more about algorithms, advanced JavaScript and handling tools like git on a more professional level. I think I can’t prepare myself too much because the real learning will happen when I’ve started to work there. </p><p>To be honest I never thought that landing my first developer job would be so smooth. There are many others who encounter more struggle and stress, but that’s okay. I’ve got huge respect for them! </p><h2 id=\"reasons-why-i-didn-t-have-to-write-an-application\">Reasons Why I Didn't Have to Write an Application</h2><p>The number one reason was my Instagram Account. Through my posts and activity on there, I was able to show that I was serious about learning and getting a job. A cool side effect was that the employer could see what I was capable of doing because I documented what I was learning and shared projects I was working on. </p><p>I was also quite lucky that I got to know the company through Instagram and didn’t have to cold call them. So, I recommend everyone to set up some type of social media account. It’s a powerful weapon in your toolkit which separates you from the majority. </p><p>It’s not granted that you’ll never have to write an application – but it makes you special in the recruiter’s eyes if you’re going the common way of landing a job. &nbsp;</p><p>Another reason why I landed the job was because I was actively working towards that goal. In other words, I concentrated my actions on landing a job. When you focus your thoughts and actions towards a specific goal you’re making luck more likely to be on your side. </p><p><strong>One of the greatest pieces of advice I can give you is to create a social media account and start putting out content while you’re coding. </strong>It can be anything. </p><p>For example, start a blog where you publish small articles about your learnings (side effect: it helps you to really understand the topic). Post on Instagram and Twitter or create YouTube videos where you talk about coding and share insights of your journey. </p><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re starting out or have got several years of experience under your belt. But try to find something which doesn’t consume more time than (learning) programming. It wouldn’t make sense to spend 20 hours a week on putting out content and only three hours on coding. Do something which is quick and easy for you and doesn’t take more than 30 minutes a day. </p><p><strong>No shame about putting yourself out there. You’ll be invited to a worldwide network of other awesome developers!</strong></p><p>If you’d like to know more about me and my life as a developer feel free to check out my Instagram @jean_marc.dev<br><br><br><br></p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;
