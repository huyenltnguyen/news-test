started in a new career as a developer is figuring out exactly what you should be learning – and then translating that into an effective plan.</p><p>There are so many resources out there for learning, so lack of information is not the problem.</p><p>The problem is two-fold:</p><p>First, it's hard to gather all this information and turn it into a cohesive plan for systematically learning what you want to learn.</p><p>Second, it's hard to figure out how to take all these resources and actually learn from them instead of just being stuck in tutorial hell forever.</p><p>The struggle is that we get sucked into the step-by-step nature of tutorials and courses and it can be hard to break out of that and do our own thing without having plan to follow.</p><p>This guide is meant to help you learn how to put together your own learning plan so you can utilize tutorials and courses while still being able to break out of the set path and begin to forge your own.</p><p>It is impossible to genuinely learn to code by just following tutorials and courses over and over again.</p><p>At some point you have to step out of the comfort zone they provide and do something on your own.</p><p>My hope is that this guide will serve as a transition aid by guiding you towards creating your own learning path instead of telling you exactly what to do.</p><h2 id=\"the-psychological-trap-of-step-by-step-paths\">The Psychological Trap of Step-by-Step Paths</h2><p>Before we get into the practical methods, we need to talk about why people get stuck in tutorial hell, and how to get out of it.</p><p>For most people, the process goes something like this:</p><p>You go through tutorials, feeling great. You are breezing through the tutorial, building something from scratch.</p><p>Maybe you run into a few small bugs, but nothing you can't work through really quickly.</p><p>You go through a few of these, building some small projects along the way.</p><p>Then you go to start building something on your own and immediately hit a wall.</p><p>You can barely get the project started before you feel like you forgot everything you just learned.</p><p>You will feel like you are starting from zero. Like everything you just spent time learning went out the window.</p><p>You feel like you didn't learn, so you find more tutorials thinking you need them to learn more before you build something on your own.</p><p>And the cycle continues.</p><p>In reality you stopped struggling too soon.</p><p>The learning doesn't happen only in the tutorials. The learning happens in that moment when most people give up and go back to the tutorials.</p><p>That struggle. That feeling like you didn't actually know anything. That's the first step of the learning process.</p><p>Don't run from it. Lean into it.</p><p>It's a lot harder to do. It's comfortable and easy to slide back into the tutorials because completing them feels good. It makes you feel like you are learning.</p><p>But it's a dangerous trap to fall into because the real learning happens as soon as you stop being comfortable and start struggling to build something on your own.</p><p>So before we get into the practical steps of designing your own learning plan, please understand this and be ready for it.</p><p>There is no shortcut, no easy step-by-step solution. You just need to accept that you are going to struggle and be confused and not know what you are doing.</p><p>That is part of the process.</p><p>That is where the real learning is taking place.</p><p>Embrace it and push through it. The rewarding feeling of having built something from scratch that doesn't exist anywhere else is worth it.</p><p>And it's what will stand out to potential employers and clients when you're trying to find work as a professional developer.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-decide-what-to-learn\">How to Decide What to Learn</h2><p>I like examples and seeing specific implementations of concepts. So in this guide, I'll talk about a concept and then give an example of me going through the process of designing a learning plan for a tech stack I've been interested in for a while: <a href=\"https://blitzjs.com/\">Blitz.js</a>.</p><p>In order to decide what you want to learn, you can take a few different criteria into account.</p><p>These will vary depending on where you are in your career.</p><p>If you are just getting started, I recommend choosing a stack with high potential for employability.</p><p>Right now I would recommend React for that.</p><p>If you are already familiar with React I would go for learning some Web3 and blockchain.</p><p>I'm 7 years into my career and am to the point where my main interest is exploring different emerging stacks that can make my job more efficient. For me that means I am interested in Blitz.js.</p><p>I love the idea of having a stack that has the same philosophy as Rails but is built on top of React and Next.js.</p><p>You may just be getting started and so you are primarily interested in learning how to build things with React so you can get your first job.</p><p>This will vary for each person, but the building blocks of that learning plan design will be the same.</p><h2 id=\"get-some-initial-exposure-to-the-tech-stack\">Get Some Initial Exposure to the Tech Stack</h2><p>The first step in learning any new stack is to simply be exposed to the basics of how it works. The best place to start with this is the official getting started tutorial provided by the stack.</p><p>Most stacks will have something like the getting started tutorial for <a href=\"https://blitzjs.com/docs/tutorial\">Blitz</a> or <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\">React</a>.</p><p>But if they don't, do a Google search for a beginner's tutorial for your stack.</p><p>After you go through the official tutorial glance through the docs. Don't try to read the docs straight through, just browse and glance to get a high-level overview.</p><p>Going through the tutorial will have the added benefit of exposing you to some of the ecosystem of your stack.</p><p>Almost everything you use will need at least some sort of other tool to work with.</p><p>Going through the tutorial and docs will help you be exposed to those initially, which will help in the next step.</p><h2 id=\"research-the-supporting-components\">Research the Supporting Components</h2><p>Now we have our initial exposure done. We are familiar with the basic concepts of the framework and at a very high level know how it works technologically.</p><p>The next step is to research the different supporting components we might want to use in building out a complete project.</p><p>So in looking at Blitz, I noticed that they have recipes for adding certain functionality to Blitz apps.</p><p>For example, they have a recipe for Tailwind CSS, which is a UI system I've used before but would like to be more proficient at.</p><p>So I'm going to add that to a list of supporting components.</p><p>Don't worry about learning it yet, just keep a list of other supporting tech you want to look into.</p><p>I'm also going to add Prisma and Render to that list, since Prisma is the database system that Blitz uses and Render is one of the recommended deployment tools.</p><p>That's all I'm going to put on my supporting components list for now, but this is an unusually short list because Blitz is designed to be an all-in-one framework.</p><p>If you are learning something more foundational, like React, you could have a potentially never-ending list of supporting components.</p><p>For now, just keep a running list of different tech you would like to learn more about and categorize it.</p><p>For example, if you chose React, you might want to learn Chakra UI, Gatsby, and Strapi CMS in order to build JAMstack sites. Those would be good things to add to a list of supporting components.</p><p>Remember, we aren't diving into these yet, as that would be too overwhelming. We're just making a list to research over time.</p><h2 id=\"build-a-complete-project\">Build a Complete Project</h2><p>Now it's time to find a course or tutorial that builds a complete project from scratch using your chosen technology. </p><p>This is to get introduced to how everything fits together and start understanding how the different components you have been researching all work to make something valuable.</p><p>Try to find something that utilizes some or all of the components you have been finding.</p><p>Don't worry if you can't find one that uses them all, that's fine. We really just want to find a source of learning that will allow us to see how this stack looks when building a complete project.</p><p>Google is your friend here, as are any groups or social media sites you are a part of.<br>I searched 'blitz complete project tutorial' on Google and found a few that look promising.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/05/image-90.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-90\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/image-90.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/image-90.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/image-90.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/05/image-90.png 2216w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"2216\" height=\"1408\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you chose React as your stack, I highly recommend the courses from <a href=\"https://wesbos.com/courses/\">Wes Bos</a> and <a href=\"https://ui.dev/courses/\">UI.dev</a>. They both focus on creating full projects and will be great for the kind of learning we're talking about here.</p><h2 id=\"build-something-from-scratch\">Build Something from Scratch</h2><p>This part is important. After that complete tutorial, stop. Don't do any more tutorials or courses until you build something from scratch.</p><p>Now we get into the hard part, but the part where the real learning takes place.</p><p>Take everything you have learned and apply it to building something on your own.</p><p>Use the resources as references, but only in the context of building your own thing.</p><p>Remember the trap we were talking about earlier. Don't fall into it.</p><p>Keep pushing forward through the struggle and work on your debugging and research skills.</p><p>Use the familiarity with the different tools you have been researching to slowly piece together a project from scratch.</p><p>Make it complete. Add a UI framework so the design looks relatively nice. Add some CI/CD and automated Git-based deployment. Make it usable.</p><p>If there are some tools you wish the tutorial/course you found had used, or even some you are interested in learning more about, use those instead.</p><p>Make your project different from the course so you can learn how to piece things together own your own.</p><p>Write some tests, add some CI/CD workflow, and get it deployed.</p><p>For example, Wes Bos has a Master Gatsby course that utilizes Sanity CMS and custom scoped CSS.</p><p>Maybe you are interested in building JAMstack sites so you decided to follow that course.</p><p>After that course you might try building your own JAMstack site using Tailwind and Strapi instead.</p><p>The point is to build something unique and on your own, referencing the content you have been reviewing up until this point as you need it.</p><p>How do you come up with ideas for things to build? Try to keep it simple and solve a very small problem you are specifically facing.</p><p>If you don't have a personal site, you could learn the JAMstack to build it.</p><p>Maybe one of your friends or family has a small hobby or business they've been wanting a website for, there's another great use case for JAMstack.</p><p>Maybe you've been struggling to make a certain change in your life because of a lack of tools, so you can build a tool to help solve it.</p><p>One of my first personal projects was an app I made called TinyThought. It was a simple Laravel app that helped me journal one sentence per day so I could build the habit.</p><p>To learn Blitz I'm thinking I might do something similar to track my strength training progress.</p><p>I'm implementing <a href=\"http://tinyhabits.com/\">Tiny Habits</a> methodology in order to be consistent with doing pushups, squats, and chin-ups.</p><p>So I might create a simple tracking app that allows me to keep track of which days I completed the habit and how many of each exercise I did.</p><h2 id=\"write-about-it\">Write About It</h2><p>Then write up how you built it.</p><p>The writing is important.</p><p>Writing will solidify your learning and help you get clear on your process more than anything else.</p><p>To really solidify learning something, teach it to someone else.</p><p>So as you are going through the process of building your custom project, write down everything you are learning, challenges you are facing, and your process for building.</p><p>You can create a series or one long, in-depth post and publish it to DEV.to, freeCodeCamp, or your own blog for other people to learn from.</p><p>If you prefer video, you can make some videos and put them up on YouTube. The ultimate form of the content doesn't matter, as long as you are teaching the process while making it as clear as possible.</p><p>Teaching other people is by far the best way to solidify your own learning and make sure you actually understand what you are doing.</p><h2 id=\"rinse-and-repeat\">Rinse and Repeat</h2><p>Now rinse and repeat this process for every new piece of tech you want to learn.</p><p>It will solidify your knowledge and build your portfolio and online presence at the same time.</p><p>Once you have this process down, it will get easier and easier every time you want to learn something new. I highly recommend you follow a process similar to this when you want to learn a new stack.</p><p>The more you do it, the more you will learn and the more your portfolio and proof of skill will grow. This is how you can leverage learning to code into work as a professional developer.</p><p>For more actionable information like this on how to start and grow a successful dev career, check out my free 10-day email course, <a href=\"https://launchyourdevcareer.com\">Launch Your Dev Career</a>.

new career can be extremely challenging and overwhelming.</p><p>The amount of information isn't the problem. We have access to more information than we ever have. The problem is knowing how to effectively execute on the information available to us.</p><p>The more I progress in my life and career, the more convinced I am that the path to success does not lie in setting massive goals, and then cranking every day to reach them.</p><p>The path lies in choosing your goals, then designing simple systems built with small habits that will facilitate achieving those goals.</p><p>But one crucial component is to not measure your success when you reach your goal, but measure your success each time you successfully execute on your system.</p><p>This means that you are in a constant state of success instead of being in a state of failure 99% of the time with brief spurts of success.</p><p>This not only is better psychologically but leads to a higher likelihood of you actually achieving your goals.</p><p>In this article we'll go over how to apply this philosophy to the goal of getting your first developer job. Although I should note that even if you are already working as a developer, these strategies will still apply to anyone looking to build a more fulfilling, robust career.</p><p>This note is important, so I'll reiterate. We are not looking for short-term wins here, we are looking to design a system and build a collection of habits that you will continue throughout the life of your career as a developer.</p><p>These habits will allow you to not only land your first job, but as you progress further and further, they will help you grow your network, influence, and skills. The byproduct of this is finding work you enjoy that pays well, and having abundant opportunities at your disposal.</p><p>Most of the ideas here have been adapted from Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg, Atomic Habits by James Clear, and my own personal experience getting my first dev job without any experience or education.</p><p>I'm currently reading Tiny Habits right now and I really like the focus on simplicity here, so we'll focus a lot on Fogg's technique for this article.</p><p>Let's get to it.</p><h2 id=\"overview-of-the-tiny-habits-method\">Overview of the Tiny Habits Method</h2><p>Very briefly, let's go over the philosophy and methodology of Tiny Habits. At its core, the system follows the idea that the best way to make consistent, lasting change is to make that change tiny – embarrassingly so.</p><p>Fogg argues that motivation is a poor tool to rely on when making lasting change. It fools us into thinking we can make significant change, because significant change is possible for a short time when we feel motivated.</p><p>The problem is that motivation doesn't last. So when the motivation wanes, you don't stick to the large, ambitious goal you set for yourself. Then you feel like a failure, so your motivation tanks more, and the cycle repeats itself for most of the big changes you want to make.</p><p>Instead, you should create the smallest possible action you can in working towards your goals.</p><p>So instead of trying to create a habit of doing 50 pushups per day, set a habit to do two.</p><p>Again, the idea rests on the habits being very very small. The point is that it should take almost no effort at all to do it. Then you instill the habit, and gradually increase the amount that you do.</p><p>As a general rule, the habit should take less than 30 seconds to complete.</p><p>Another crucial concept focuses on celebrating your wins immediately. You want to make the connection in your brains between successfully completing the habit and positive emotions.</p><p>It's cheesy, but I do a little mini dance every time I complete mine, a little something like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/05/image-55.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-55\" width=\"245\" height=\"195\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The other key component of creating Tiny Habits is the recipe. Tiny Habit recipes follow this formula:</p><p>After I [anchor action], I will [tiny habit].</p><p>This anchor action is crucial. This is a task that you already complete and that is already a solid part of your schedule that you anchor your new habit to.</p><p>It should be in the same location and have the same context as your new tiny habit.</p><p>So here's an example of a bad anchor and tiny habit:</p><p>After I take the dog out, I will floss one tooth.</p><p>Because the location and context are so different, this is unlikely to stick. Here's a better option:</p><p>After I brush my teeth, I will floss one tooth.</p><p>Again, I highly recommend you check out Fogg's book, Tiny Habits, for a much more thorough exploration of this method.</p><p>For now, let's look at how we can apply this method to launching a successful dev career.</p><h2 id=\"tasks-to-focus-on\">Tasks to Focus On</h2><p>We want to focus on three main components for building out our dev career:</p><ol><li>Develop your skills</li><li>Establish an online presence</li><li>Start networking</li></ol><p>Let's briefly go over these, and then we'll cover how to translate them into the Tiny Habit methodology.</p><h3 id=\"develop-your-skills\">Develop Your Skills</h3><p>This one is pretty self-explanatory. You need to grow your development skills if you want to be a developer. The key here is to make sure you <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-from-coding-tutorials-and-avoid-tutorial-hell/\">don't get stuck in tutorial hell forever</a>.</p><p>Tutorial hell is appealing because following tutorials and courses does not take nearly as much mental or creative energy as building something from scratch does.</p><p>So you fool yourself into thinking you are learning when all you are really doing is copying what someone else did.</p><p>But building that out, having it work smoothly, and then seeing the finished product makes your brain feel good, so the habit solidifies and the cycle continues.</p><p>Here you want to start building the tiny habit of writing your own code and building your own things so you can replace that feedback loop with a more useful one.</p><h3 id=\"establish-an-online-presence\">Establish an Online Presence</h3><p>Building an online presence encompasses a few different things. The most important are social media and your portfolio site. When I say social media I mean Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><p>Say what you want about them – and I definitely have my issues – but they are invaluable when trying to start and grow a career.</p><p>As with most things, the key to growing on these platforms is to be consistent. So this is a perfect fit for the Tiny Habits framework, too.</p><p>Engagement on these platforms is huge, especially at the beginning when your account is still small, so you really want to make sure you are showing up every day.</p><h3 id=\"start-networking\">Start Networking</h3><p>Finally we have networking. Although there is some networking included in our online presence component because of interacting with other people, the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/networking-for-aspiring-developers/\">networking we want to focus on here is more direct</a>.</p><p>When you are first starting out, it can be very helpful to start reaching out to companies you admire directly, telling them so, and introducing yourself.</p><p>This is a bit of a secret weapon because very few people do it, but it's very powerful.</p><p>Let's look at how we can create some Tiny Habits around these three main goals. Remember, the goal is to start embedding the habit in your brain. Then you can increase the amount of each of these things over time.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-develop-tiny-habits\">How to Develop Tiny Habits</h2><p>You'll need to come up with the anchor actions on your own. Anchor actions are specific to each person, because they consist of things you already do as part of your routine.</p><p>So I'll give you recommended Tiny Habits, along with my anchors, but ultimately you'll need to come up with your own.</p><p>For skill development, I recommend something very simple:</p><p><strong>After I take my first sip of coffee, I will write one line of code in my own project.</strong></p><p>Remember, the anchor action should be specific to you. I already make coffee before I start working in the morning, so the first sip is my anchor.</p><p>Don't discount this because of the simplicity and ease of the task. That's the point. Make it ridiculously easy to start and the snowball will grow as you gradually increase the task.</p><p>Now, for online presence:</p><p><strong>After I check my email, I will write one thoughtful reply on Twitter.</strong></p><p>Again, I'm using what is an existing part of my routine and then anchoring my habit to that.</p><p>Finally, for networking:</p><p><strong>After I check Twitter, I will write down one person I want to reach out to.</strong></p><p>Same concept here.</p><p>These are just examples, and I recommend you start with just these three for a few days while you get used to how this works. Then you can gradually start to expand the habits and start to add more for the particular tasks you have.</p><p>Please don't overcomplicate this or try to add anything more. The goal is to make it so small and so easy that it feels stupid and pointless to not do it. These will begin to compound as you begin to build that habit and execute on it every day.</p><p>And don't forget the celebration! That part is crucial for forming the pathways in your brain that will make executing on these actions sustainable and fun.</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h2><p>So much of why people struggle to make progress on their goals is because they go too big too fast or struggle with information overload.</p><p>This simple system solves both of those problems, but we naturally resist it because it seems too small to make a difference.</p><p>In reality, when we go overboard for a day or two, then burn out for a week or two, we are taking one step forward and two steps back. No matter how big the steps are, we aren't making progress.</p><p>But when we implement the Tiny Habits method, we might be taking miniature little baby steps, but we're taking them every day and always forward.</p><p>Finally, if you would like a step-by-step walkthrough on how to land that first web developer job, I have a free 10-day email course at <a href=\"https://LaunchYourDevCareer.com\">LaunchYourDevCareer.com</a>. It covers a lot of what we talked about here plus a lot more in order to give you a concrete path to that first job.</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

whom you know.\"</p><p>\"70-80% of jobs are found via someone's network.\"</p><p>Most of us have heard cliches and stats like the above. And I think most of us intuitively know that having a network of people that can help us find opportunities is a good thing.</p><p>Using the spray and pray approach and applying to as many jobs as possible doesn't work very well anymore.</p><p>But this can be one of those vague, nebulous concepts that we all know is a good thing to do and have – but actually going about it is difficult.</p><p>If you want to grow a successful career and keep your job opportunities open, you need to learn how to network.</p><p>There are two main obstacles when trying to successfully network as a developer.</p><ol><li>It has a bad connotation and reputation</li><li>It's hard to do right</li></ol><p>These two things are related, so let's tackle the first here then get into some practical ways to do it right.</p><h2 id=\"networking-has-a-bad-connotation\">Networking Has a Bad Connotation</h2><p>We associate networking with irritating events and transparently fake attempts to make friends and get stuff.</p><p>Or at a slightly less horrible level, reaching out to a bunch of random people on Twitter, having awkward conversations, and trying to find something in common with them out of thin air. Maybe you'll get a response if you're lucky, and then it fizzles out from there.</p><p>But real, effective networking isn't about any of this.</p><p>You don't have to constantly pester people asking for stuff, attend awkward events, or initiate fake conversations.</p><p>Because of modern technological miracles, it's as simple as interacting with people on Twitter and sending some emails. And it doesn't have to be awkward.</p><p>Now, I say simple, but simple doesn't mean easy.</p><p>How in the world are you supposed to strike up a conversation with some random person you don't know, and then if you have a hard time with that, how can you possibly leverage that relationship into a job?</p><p>The thing to keep in mind is that networking is a long game. If you approach networking selfishly or with short-term goals in mind, it will not work.</p><p>If you approach networking as a way to make new friends, build real relationships, and add value where you can, it will create a snowball effect.</p><p>This doesn't mean it can't benefit you – it can and should. Networking should be mutually beneficial to each person involved. The reason networking has a bad connotation is because when networking is done right it doesn't feel like networking. It feels like making new friends and helping each other out where you can.</p><p>The ultimate goal is to create a strong enough network that you don't ever have to worry about finding work. You have built enough of a reputation with enough people that you can simply put a call out to your network and you'll have opportunities coming to you.</p><p>Long-term networking pays off because you have built enough social capital with enough people that you can ask for opportunities when you need them. And that social capital you've been investing will be returned.</p><p>This, however, takes a long time. So you need to approach this genuinely and patiently.</p><p>Now, there are ways to use short-term networking to stand out and get jobs, but it's a very specific strategy that needs to be handled directly and honestly because it has a stated, specific goal that you are trying to achieve. When done right this can be very powerful. We'll get into both long-term networking strategy and short-term networking strategy in this article.</p><p>You can do all your long-term networking these days indirectly by simply interacting with people on social media and maybe sending some emails.</p><p>Because of the power of the Internet, we can begin to build relationships with people with nothing but an email address and a few social media accounts.</p><p>I have my issues with social media, but it is a tremendously valuable tool when it comes to networking, specifically Twitter.</p><p>Every day I see people posting stories of how they started simply building relationships on Twitter and now they have freelance work, have received job offers, and generally are building very successful careers on the back of social media.</p><p>Now let's get into some practical ways to actually go about doing this.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-network-effectively\">How to Network Effectively</h2><p>Let's dive into specifics for how to actually do this. We'll be using two main tools: Twitter and email.</p><p>Side note: LinkedIn is underrated as a platform for landing a job, but it can be very valuable. I wanted to focus on one social media tool here, but if you are interested in using LinkedIn to land your first job, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG5Sb5WTV_g&amp;list=PL54X5yR8qizsMpvTCqUIEFMeEp-chvcxk\">this video series</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev\">Danny Thompson</a>.</p><p>We'll focus on social media for our more generalized, long-term networking, and then dive into a specific tactic using email to make yourself stand out to potential employers.</p><p>You won't have to cold call people, attend events, or send awkward, desperate emails/DMs asking for stuff.</p><p>Just genuine connection and relationship-building with people you admire.</p><h3 id=\"long-term-networking-with-twitter\">Long Term Networking with Twitter</h3><p>The goal here is very simple: to increase your visibility. After you've <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-credibility-as-a-new-developer/\">constructed a good online presence</a>, consisting of complete Twitter profiles, a complete and active GitHub profile, and a <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/\">good portfolio site</a>, you need to get people to actually see it.</p><p>This is the kind of networking we're going to be focusing on: utilizing social media platforms to increase your visibility.</p><p>Over time, people on Twitter will start to become familiar with you and your skillset and personality. Then, people will start approaching you for different opportunities as you naturally show your skills and personality.</p><p>How do you do this?</p><p>By liking and commenting on stuff, following people, and connecting with people.</p><p>Yes. It is that simple. People try to overthink social media and come up with some crazy system or hack. But if you talk to the people that actually succeed with it, they all treated it as just genuinely sharing their thoughts, what they were working on, posting thoughtful replies to Tweets when relevant, and just being a human being.</p><p>The really cool thing about Twitter is that their algorithm works off of spreading content. So when you like or comment on someone's post, their network will see that, or at least some of it.</p><p>People try to come up with the best systems and hacks to gain followers and grow their network. But I recommend just using the platforms as they were designed to be used. It really can be that simple.</p><p>Don't underestimate the power of this because it is simple and obvious. Everybody wants some sort of step-by-step system or hack to do things, but the most effective way to network is by just being a genuine person.</p><p>This is the most effective way to start because everyone can do it. It doesn't require spamming peoples' inbox, making cold calls, or talking to anyone in person.</p><p>All you are doing is using social media as it was intended to be used, by genuinely interacting with people.</p><p>This is real networking at its finest: simple, genuine, and something you can do every day.</p><p>Don't try to overcomplicate this. Once you get started with this simple step, you'll gradually start learning how to effectively interact with people over time and naturally get better and better and building relationships and connections.</p><p>Now, with that said, it can be difficult to come into this having never done it before and be able to do anything. So here's a starting point of a few simple things you should do every day.</p><p>Start with this template, and naturally grow it into doing your own thing.</p><p>These steps assume you are already following a decent number of people in the developer community. So if you aren't, look for some first. If you've been on Twitter any amount of time, you likely are already following some people.</p><p>A few general tips before we get into the specific steps:</p><ul><li>All of this needs to be genuine. No spammy, \"Awesome job!\" or \"Nice!\" replies. Only tweet if you have something of value to add to the conversation.</li><li>If you are able to, getting to a conversation earlier is usually better</li><li>Don't target accounts with too large of a following. If you are just getting started, accounts with less than 15,000 followers are a good goal to engage with and then you can scale up as you start to grow.</li><li>Experiment with schedulers, but don't feel tied to them. I tried one for a while and found I was able to be more consistent when I tweeted thoughts or realizations as they occurred to me</li><li>Try to set aside engagement time. It can be easy to get lost in Twitter, so try to set specific engagement time each day so you don't kill your productivity</li></ul><ol><li>Reply to 5 tweets from people that you admire with relatively large followings</li><li>DM one person you admire thanking them for something and telling them why you like it</li><li>Try to tweet out 3-5 high-value tweets per day. High-value can mean something insightful, a specific method for doing something, an update on what you are working on (working in public is a fantastic networking strategy), or even simply an honest thought that you don't hear very often</li></ol><p>I can't give you formulas for what to Tweet because that will defeat the purpose. There are plenty of those floating around and they may get high engagement but they are generally annoying and people are getting sick of them.</p><p>Be honest, be genuine, and start now. It will get easier and you will get better as you go.</p><p>Start with these three simple steps and scale from there. But start small and simple because consistency is what is important here.</p><h3 id=\"short-term-networking-with-cold-email\">Short Term Networking with Cold Email</h3><p>Alright now we're going to get into a somewhat controversial method of networking. But it's one of my favorites not only for networking, but for directly landing a job.</p><p>The cool thing about this method is that the primary goal is to make yourself stand out to land a job, but it's an indirect networking tool as well.</p><p>Because even if you don't land a job directly from it, you have placed yourself in someone's mind as unique and willing to go the extra mile for something they care about.</p><p>Basically it comes down to these steps: </p><ol><li>Finding a few, say 5-10, companies you really admire and want to work for</li><li>Finding the best contact person at the company</li><li>Finding their email address (Twitter DMs and LinkedIn messages could also work if you can't find an email)</li><li>Figure out something small of value you could contribute and build a small mini-project custom for them that demonstrates that thing of value</li><li>Send in a video pitch introducing yourself, talking about why you love that company in particular, and talking about why you would be a great addition to the team</li></ol><p>These are just the basic steps broken down, and there is a lot to this process. But you can learn a lot more about the specifics from the company I learned this from, <a href=\"https://crash.co/\">Crash</a>.</p><p>They have a software, book, and course that go into this stuff in great detail. It's a game-changer because nobody is willing to put in the time to do this because everyone gets so trapped in the traditional permission-based routes like job boards and applications.</p><p>By showing you are willing to step outside those comfort zones, you will be extremely attractive to potential employers and build a valuable network in the process.</p><p>There are three critical components of this that make it so effective:</p><ol><li>Showing you are capable of thinking outside the box and taking initiative despite perceived roadblocks</li><li>Showing your skills by building something real, instead of just talking about your skills like you would on a résumé or job application</li><li>Facilitating human connection by recording a short, personalized video of yourself</li></ol><p>We covered the first one above, so let's talk about the other two and get into a few specifics of how you can pull this off. Again, I learned this from Crash so check them out if you want more details. All credit for this technique goes to them.</p><p>One of the most powerful aspects of this strategy is that you are taking the time to build a small custom project that is relevant to this particular company.</p><p>Keep in mind this project doesn't have to be anything crazy – an hour or two worth of work – and the company doesn't ever have to necessarily use it.</p><p>The goal is simply to show that you know enough about the company to build something somewhat relevant to them, prove that you have the skills you say you do, and stand out by showing that you are willing to put in that much effort to that company.</p><p>Free work gets a bad rap, and when free work is specifically requested from a company, like some companies that ask someone to build an entire functioning application as a sample project for an interview, that's crap.</p><p>But choosing to take the initiative to build something like that on your own is a great use of your time.</p><p>Facilitating human connection is the third really big benefit of this. When you are recording your pitch video, the goal is to communicate who you are very briefly, talk about why you admire that company and want to work for them, talk about the skills you have, and then talk about why those skills would be valuable to that company.</p><p>This combined with the custom project is insanely powerful. Try to keep it short, around 2 minutes, smile, breath, and write some bullet points.</p><p>Don't write a script, as that will come off as robotic. Just jot down some bullets to cover so you don't get off track.</p><p>My favorite way to do all this is to create a custom page on your portfolio site dedicated to the company.</p><p>Then you can put your custom project on there, embed your video, and send out a simple cold email to the right contact person.</p><p>I'm a big fan of writing extremely short, direct cold emails.</p><p>Let's see what this might look like in practice.</p><p>Imagine I'm a React developer with a strong affinity for design. So I want to be able to combine my React skills with my design skills and do some front-end development with a heavy focus on implementing great design.</p><p><em>Side note: This is an excellent example of skill stacking, combining two different but complimentary skillsets to make yourself more unique and valuable to companies.</em></p><p>Say I want to work for a company called Paperize. They take peoples' handwritten notes and digitize them. This is a fictional company I just made up, so any resemblance to a real company is purely coincidental.</p><p>I found the Lead Developer and decide they would be the best person to reach out to, since based on my research of the company on their website, LinkedIn, and content they have written. This person seems to be heavily involved in the hiring process but more easily accessible than the CEO.</p><p>So I take a detailed look at their website and notice a couple of things:</p><ol><li>They talk a lot about flexibility being important for employees on their website. This is extremely important to me as well, so I jot that down as something to mention in the video. However, I also know being effective at a remote job with asynchronous schedules requires a certain amount of discipline to be productive, so I want to make sure I say I have experience doing that</li><li>There's a form on their website that's a little clunky, so I can spend an hour or so rebuilding that form in React to function better and make a better UX for it.</li></ol><p>So now I'll build that and record my video saying something along the lines of:</p><blockquote>\"Hey Paperize! I'm Ken, I'm a React developer looking to contribute my development and UX skills to an amazing company. I've been following Paperize for a while and really admire your focus on taking something that's mundane but that everybody does and that's important, and turning it into something extremely easy.<br><br>I was looking at your website and noticed that there is a form on your contact page that could use a little love, so I went ahead and coded a new one up in React for you that has a nice, smooth UX for the user. The code and lie demo are below.<br><br>I love Paperize and think that my combination of React skills with my love for clean UX would make a great addition to the team.<br><br>Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this! You can email me at email@example.com or give me a call at 123-555-1234 so we can get to know each other more and I look forward to hearing from you!\"</blockquote><p>Something like that would work great.</p><p>Then I would set this up on a page on my website dedicated to Paperize and send the Lead Developer a super short email like:</p><p>Subject: I want to work for Paperize</p><p>\"Hey Dan,</p><p>Big fan of Paperize and your work, so I made you something.</p><p>[link to it]</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Ken\"</p><p>Keep it super simple. Your goal here is not to get a job, it's to pique their interest enough to click the link in the email, and then pique their interest enough to follow up with you.</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2><p>There is a lot more to networking than what I covered here, but often the hardest part is just having a concrete starting point, so I wanted to give you that here.</p><p>If you are looking for a concrete, step-by-step plan to land your first job as a developer, along with support from myself and community of peers, I think you'd love being a member of my combination course/community, <a href=\"https://lever.so\">Lever</a>.</p><p>Thanks so much for taking the time out of your day to read this, and good luck on your networking journey!</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

of platform.</p><p>Some people love it for the opportunities it provides and the ease with which it facilitates professional connections.</p><p>Other people hate it because it often seems like it has a veneer of genuine connection while the substance is mostly self-serving networking.</p><p>In reality, both of these extremes have a degree of truth to them.</p><p>LinkedIn is not a magical solution where you can create an account and instantly be discovered by hundreds of companies eager to throw money at you.</p><p>But it is also not the cesspool of recruiters and fake networkers sending out spammy connection requests all day.</p><p>Despite what you might think about the platform, the reality is that, when used correctly, LinkedIn provides an excellent opportunity for you to stand out, get noticed, and get hired, even if you don't have professional experience.</p><p>The key lies in the <em>when used correctly</em> part of that sentence.</p><p>So today we're going to go through some strategies that you can can use to leverage LinkedIn to get you that crucial first job.</p><p>We'll cover both profile setup and connection/networking strategies. These will help you increase your visibility to recruiters and employers searching for developers, and start to form relationships with people in the industry who can bring you valuable opportunities.</p><p>I love examples, so I'm going to walk you through this using an example as if I was a new React developer trying to get my first job.</p><p>You can follow along using your specific situation and goals.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-set-up-your-linkedin-profile\">How to Set Up your LinkedIn Profile</h2><p>The main goal with setting up your profile in LinkedIn is to make it easier for the right people to find you, mainly recruiters and employers.</p><p>Recruiters are not the only people scouring LinkedIn for good candidates. Small agencies and other small companies that may not have the resources for a recruiter also use LinkedIn in order to find good talent.</p><p>We want to be visible to both groups of people here, so when they are searching for someone matching your skillset they find you.</p><p>Let's go through each component of a strong LinkedIn profile.</p><h3 id=\"use-the-right-keywords\">Use the Right Keywords</h3><p>It all starts with the keywords. Your keywords are how you are going to structure the content of your profile. We'll include these keywords in relevant parts of your profile where it makes sense. But we'll make sure to maintain readability so you don't sound like a robot and still appeal to the humans actually looking at your profile.</p><p>Some keywords I might want to include might be React, GraphQL, and Node if I'm going for a full-stack JS developer position.</p><p>I like to go more specific and put the specific technologies I am learning and want to work with, rather than going too broad, like JavaScript.</p><p>At the same time, there's a balance here. You can also go too narrow and put things that not a lot of people are going to be searching for.</p><p>An example of something too narrow might be Next, Firebase, and Tailwind. Those are very specific technologies and the likelihood of someone searching specifically for those is less than React.</p><p>But, somebody who knows React and can demonstrate some basic proficiency in a few different stacks based in React will be appealing to someone even if the specific stack they are using differs from your specific stack.</p><p>The main thing we want to communicate here is that you have knowledge using certain technologies you want to work in while communicating the fact that you are capable of learning others.</p><p>For this example I'm going to go with React, GraphQL, and Node as my keywords.</p><h3 id=\"compose-your-intro\">Compose Your Intro</h3><p>The intro portion of your profile is comprised of your photo, headline, banner image, name, location, and your URL.</p><p>It forms the first impression people will get of you and your profile, so it's important to get it right. Let's go through each component of the intro section one at a time.</p><p>First, the big three.</p><p>These first three components are what will show up anytime you interact with anyone on LinkedIn or show up in someone's feed.</p><p>They are the only parts that people will see even if they don't click through to your profile, so make them count.</p><h4 id=\"your-name\">Your Name</h4><p>Pretty self-explanatory. Use your real first and last name. Nicknames are fine, as long as that is what you would go by if you were to get hired somewhere.</p><p>Keep it consistent across all your profiles and your website if possible, as this strengthens the branding aspect of your online presence.</p><p>Example: My name is Kenneth Rogers but my LinkedIn says Ken Rogers because that is usually what I go by, and that's what I go by on all my social media profiles.</p><h4 id=\"profile-photo\">Profile Photo</h4><p>Your profile photo is an important part of your profile.</p><p>There's some disagreement about whether or not you should have a photo of yourself in your social media profiles.</p><p>Some people think it can cause unnecessary unconscious bias in people who look at your profile.</p><p>While this may be true, let's look at the alternative.</p><p>Whether we like it or not, having an empty spot where you profile photo gives the look of incompleteness.</p><p>So the unconscious bias is unavoidable. It's part of the process, whether we like it or not.</p><p>I think having a high-quality photo is a much better decision that leaving it empty or using something that is not actually you.</p><p>For the photo, the basics apply.</p><p>Clear, high-quality headshot, preferably smiling, with a neutral background that is not distracting.</p><p>If you are able to do so, hire a professional, but I realize not everyone can do that.</p><p>Luckily smartphones have amazing capabilities these days. By asking a friend who knows what they are doing or by learning a bit about phone photography yourself, you can take a great picture that gives a good first impression.</p><p>Make it so that if someone met you in person after looking at your profile, they would easily recognize you. No pets or family, just a clear headshot of you.</p><h4 id=\"headline\">Headline</h4><p>The headline is one of the most important pieces of your LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Even though it's short, it has a high impact on your search visibility and on whether or not somebody will click through to learn more about you.</p><p>So what makes a good headline? It needs to appeal to both human readers and the LinkedIn search engine at the same time.</p><p>That means it needs to be clear and concise in communicating exactly what it is you do (or want to do).\t</p><p>One thing I do not recommend doing is putting words like \"Junior\", \"Aspiring\", or \"Student\", in your profile.</p><p>If you currently create things using code, you are currently a developer, you just may not have an official job title.</p><p>Get rid of any language that says you are not currently a developer. It's not about lying, we're not going to fake any experience you don't actually have.</p><p>It's about having confidence in your abilities and yourself to call yourself what you are, a developer: someone who creates things with code.</p><p>Your headline should include your specialty (what you want to work in) and your unique value proposition (what you specifically bring to the table).</p><p>The first part is pretty self-explanatory, but how can you have a unique value proposition as a brand new developer?</p><p>This can be as simple as what you want your specialty to be or unique things you have accomplished with past projects.</p><p>Do you have an interest in accessibility and did you build a project that incorporates accessibility? That's a recipe for a compelling headline that helps you stand out.</p><p>Something like, \"React developer building highly-accessible web applications.\"</p><p>We've got one of our keywords in there, potentially two if you identified accessibility as a keyword, and it clearly communicates the value you bring to the table for companies.</p><p>For my profile, I'll go with \"Building excellent user experiences in React and GraphQL\".</p><p>I want to be a React developer and I have a passion for crafting excellent user experiences.</p><p>For you, this might be clean code, well-tested code, and so on.</p><p>Choose something that you uniquely focus on that adds value to organizations.</p><p>This doesn't have to be technical, either. If you come from a background that utilized other soft skills that are relevant to development, integrate that in there.</p><p>Let's say you used to work in customer service, so communication is one of your strong skills.</p><p>You might make your headline \"Building React applications that effectively solve client problems\" because your communication skills allow you to ensure that you are clear on the client needs and the tools you build accomplish that task well.</p><p>Something to decide here is which part of your headline you want at the beginning. Only the first 65 to 80 characters will be shown in search results and content feeds depending on if you are on mobile or desktop.</p><p>So you need to decide which aspect of your work is more important and put that first.</p><h4 id=\"banner-image\">Banner Image</h4><p>Customizing your banner image is another one of those little details that communicates that you took the time to customize your profile and really care about how it looks.</p><p>There are two options for your banner image.</p><p>If you can find a stock photo or a photo you took that communicates something about you, you can use that.</p><p>For example, I live in Colorado and love the mountains, so I might choose a mountain photo.</p><p>It does not necessarily have to communicate something professional about you, but it shouldn't be generic.</p><p>For example, don't use a picture of a computer with code on it, since that doesn't do anything to differentiate you from other new developers.</p><p>The other option is to create your own banner image that communicates your career goals.</p><p>Lots of consultants do this, and I have something similar on mine.</p><p>You can do this using Canva or hire someone on Fiverr.</p><p>Some things you could put on the banner:</p><ul><li>Icons of the tech you work with</li><li>Another picture of you with an overlay and some text describing what you can bring to the table</li></ul><p>Here are a few examples of this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/02/image-96.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-96\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-96.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-96.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/image-96.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/02/image-96.png 1720w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"1720\" height=\"604\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Here Justin highlights his primary professional driver and lists his website.</p><p>This is a great example if you have a specific mission that drives you to code.</p><p>As you can see, the banner image doesn't have to be fancy or complicated, simpler is usually better.</p><p>Here's what mine looks like:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/02/image-98.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-98\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-98.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-98.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/02/image-98.png 1582w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"1582\" height=\"730\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Personally, I would go with this second style of banner, where you have some text describing what you do, over the first. It gives more clarity on you as a person. </p><p>Although if you are having trouble coming up with something like this, a beautiful picture that still communicates something about you is better than the default.</p><h4 id=\"url\">URL</h4><p>Customizing your URL is one of those little details that takes 10 seconds but adds that little bit of polish to your profile.</p><p>Change your URL to some form of your first and last name. You can also add in initials and other forms of your name if necessary.</p><p>For example, I usually go by Ken Rogers or Kenny Rogers, but those were both taken so my URL is https://linkedin.com/in/kennetharogers, which uses both my full first name and my middle initial.</p><h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3><p>Opinions vary on the best length for a summary, but I am personally inclined to recommend shorter summaries.</p><p>One thing I've noticed is that people feel like they need to include their entire life story in their summary or in places like their portfolio site about page.</p><p>Think about your online profiles like online writing.</p><p>In writing, the only goal of the headline or introduction is to get the reader to read the next line.</p><p>Your goal with your LinkedIn headline and summary is not to get hired, it's to get the person viewing your profile interested enough to just take the next step. That might be sending you a DM on LinkedIn, sending you an email, or visiting your portfolio site.</p><p>This job hunt process should be viewed in this step-by-step manner. It helps keep you focused on what each component is best used for and avoids overwhelming people with too much information too soon.</p><p>So how can we apply that to your summary?</p><p>You want to hook the reader in on the first two lines of the summary, since LinkedIn requires you to hit the \"Show More\" button in order to view beyond that.</p><p>To make this a bit easier to write, I like to use the following structure:</p><ul><li>Hook</li><li>Mission</li><li>Expertise</li><li>Proof</li><li>CTA</li></ul><p>In the hook, you want to use something unique and interesting about you and open up a loop that can only be closed by reading further. This is how you'll get the reader to read your entire summary.</p><p>I like to integrate something from my background and why I got into coding here. You can also hint at something that happened to you during that process that gets explained later in the summary.</p><p>So if I was doing this for my example, I might write something like this:</p><p>\"It was many late nights spent coding after driving a forklift all day before I built my first web app. But when I did, I learned something unexpected about myself.\"</p><p>This captures the reader's attention by showing that I am motivated to learn and dedicated to doing so, briefly mentions I've built something from start to finish, and hints that I learned something, which we'll continue explaining in the mission section.</p><p>\"I learned why I truly love to code. That particular app was built to solve a small problem I had in my life, consistent journaling, and by completing it I realized the immense satisfaction I get from building something real, that makes someone's life easier, using nothing but code and my own effort.\"</p><p>Now we're starting to get into why I actually code. This is more important than people realize. Hiring, as much as some companies try to make it, is not an automated, robotic process.</p><p>It's people who will be looking at your profile, reaching out to you, and hiring you. You need to connect on a personal level in order to catch someone's attention.</p><p>Now let's dive into our expertise by moving into talking about how we actually accomplish the \"what\" and \"why\" listed above.</p><p>This is another spot you'll want to use those keywords you chose earlier. In this example, I chose React, GraphQL, and Node. With that in mind, here's how I might write this section of my summary.</p><p>\"I'm obsessed with solving complex problems using React, GraphQL, and Node by building web applications with an emphasis and accessibility and usability.\"</p><p>Anyone can say these things, you also need to back it up with proof. That means you need to have a built a complete project or two using the exact tools and concepts you discuss in this section.</p><p>We'll go into that in just a second, first let's round out this section with a clear CTA so readers know what we are looking for.</p><p>\"I'm currently looking to contribute my skills to a team where I can prove my skills while growing in my capabilities. If you are looking for a competent, highly-motivated developer, let's chat. You can reach me at email@example.com or by DMing me here on LinkedIn.\"</p><p>This gives people a clear action to take and shows them exactly what you are looking for.</p><p>Now, on to that proof we were talking about.</p><p>Rather than just listing it out here, I like to include links that link to a project or two, and maybe a piece of writing that showcases the attributes you've written about here.</p><p>You can utilize the \"Featured\" section for that.</p><h3 id=\"featured\">Featured</h3><p>The featured section is simple but very powerful.</p><p>What I recommend doing here is linking to a project or two that lines up with the skills and attributes you listed in your summary, and maybe a piece of writing or two that does the same.</p><p>For the projects, don't just link to a live version of the project or a GitHub page. You should have a dedicated page on your portfolio site that walks readers through how and why you built the project.</p><p>Building a portfolio site is outside the scope of this guide, but I highly recommend reading Josh Comeau's <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/\">book on building great portfolio sites</a>.</p><h3 id=\"experience\">Experience</h3><p>What can you put in the experience section when you don't have any experience?</p><p>There is almost always relevant experience that can be used even if your other jobs were in another field.</p><p>Learning how to communicate they ways in which your soft skills learned in other fields are relevant to web development is going to be critical here.</p><p>What I recommend doing is looking at this <a href=\"https://epicassist.org/the-10-soft-skills-employers-value-the-most/\">list of skills</a> that virtually every employer values. Then see which of those you had to utilize in your previous jobs and how that translates to being a good developer.</p><p>Be sure to list any specific accomplishments and awards you received as well as concrete examples of demonstrating those skills.</p><p>For example, I used to be a server and drove a forklift before I became a developer.</p><p>A couple of skills from that list that I had to use quite often were communication and adaptability.</p><p>So let's see how I could integrate that into my experience.</p><p>I might write something like this in my server experience section:</p><p>\"Simultaneously served multiple tables while ensuring their orders were correct and guests were satisfied. Adapted to changing demands by performing multiple duties such as hosting and bussing as restaurant traffic increased and decreased throughout multiple shifts.\"</p><p>This is a simple example, but it communicates that I am able to handle multiple responsibilities while maintaining good communication and customer service, and that I am adaptable and willing to help out the team even if it means doing a job that is not necessarily my primary function.</p><p>One mistake I see a lot of people make is just stating that they have certain skills instead of showing it with examples. This is one way to do that.</p><p>If you have done any freelance work, you can also put that here as relevant work experience if you did it under a company name, or even your own name.</p><p>Make sure to focus on results delivered to clients or employers. If you can, list specific things you accomplished and how that contributed value to the organization or person you worked for.</p><h3 id=\"education\">Education</h3><p>If you have formal education or a bootcamp under your belt, you can put that here.</p><p>Besides that, put any course work you've completed here. Things like Udemy courses or freeCodeCamp curriculum certificates should be included here as well. Any structured training program or course you've taken should be included in the Education section.</p><h3 id=\"skills\">Skills</h3><p>For your skills, I recommend choosing the top three based on the keywords you've chosen. These top three are the most crucial and will be used to filter your profile.</p><p>As for the rest, my preferred rule of thumb is to include any skills you have used to build a complete project.</p><p>Don't list every piece of tech you've ever touched here, as that is a subtle hint to employers and recruiters that you are desperate to get whatever job you can. And it's virtually impossible for someone to be proficient in that many things.</p><h3 id=\"recommendations\">Recommendations</h3><p>If you can get them, recommendations are great. Try to get recommendations from people you have worked for in the past.</p><p>These aren't required as getting them depends on external factors, but get one or two if you are able to.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-amplify-your-reach-on-linkedin\">How to Amplify Your Reach on LinkedIn</h2><p>You've got your profile nailed down, now it's time to get it in front of people.</p><p>The other half of LinkedIn is using it properly in order to meet the right kind of people and get on their radar as someone who will be a valuable addition to their organization.</p><p>You have the foundation in place in your properly created profile, now you need to get it in front of as many eyes as possible.</p><p>You've optimized your profile to take advantage of LinkedIn's search functionality, but you don't only want to be passive in this process.</p><p>You also want to be active in getting in front of the right eyes.</p><p>This isn't going to be some awkward process. We'll mostly just be connecting with people and posting content.</p><p>You won't have to send any DMs or try to sell yourself on LinkedIn.</p><p>This is a two-part process:</p><ol><li>Connecting with people</li><li>Writing compelling content</li></ol><h3 id=\"how-to-connect-with-people-on-linkedin\">How to Connect with People on LinkedIn</h3><p>Let's talk about connecting with people first.</p><p>You want to be intentional about the people you are connecting with. The best way to do that is to connect vertically.</p><p>Most people focus a good chunk of their networking on horizontal connections. This means that they connect with people at the same level as they are.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with this, and I'm not saying you shouldn't do that. But your effort is better spent on people who are either in a position you want to be in, or are in a position that hires people like you.</p><p>So a good place to start is to start looking up companies you admire and would want to work for, and start connecting with employees at that company, people that currently do what you want to do, and people in charge of hiring at that company.</p><p>As you do this, LinkedIn will start to suggest relevant people to connect with, making this process a lot easier and faster.</p><p>I have conflicting feelings on connection request messages. On one hand, I understand the value of customized messages, but on the other, I actually tend to see better acceptance rates with the default message. So I don't write custom messages anymore.</p><p>This is something you'll want to experiment with for yourself.</p><p>Try both and see what works better for you. For your custom messages, keep it simple and say you are a new developer looking to connect with other people in the industry.</p><p>That's it. You don't need to send a personal DM or try to form a friendship with them now. You're just trying to grow your network and increase your visibility. The long-term connection is going to come in the form of creating valuable, interesting content.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-write-good-content-and-share-it-on-linkedin\">How to Write Good Content and Share it on LinkedIn</h3><p>So how do you write engaging content on LinkedIn that makes people want to learn more about you?</p><p>My favorite method is to be working on a project, and write about what I'm learning during your process But – and this is an important distinction – write about it from the perspective of a teacher/authority.</p><p>What I mean by this is that instead of writing \"I learned this today\" write \"Here's how to do this.\"</p><p>And LinkedIn is better for high-level, conceptual types of content rather than overly technical types.</p><p>So write about the high-level lessons you are learning, rather than the technical things themselves.</p><p>So let's say I was working on a project using Gatsby and after a bit of struggle, I figured out how to turn it into a PWA without following a tutorial, just the docs.</p><p>I might write a post along these lines:</p><blockquote>\"Today I managed to accomplish turning my Gatsby site into a Progressive Web App without following a tutorial.<br><br>Tutorials and courses are great, but the real learning occurs when we struggle through implementing a solution on our own, dealing with the inevitable bugs and setbacks along the way.<br><br>Whenever you're slogging through a problem and struggling to come up with a solution, know that struggle is your brain adapting to a new situation and learning.<br><br>This is where real growth happens.\"</blockquote><p>You want your content to communicate the fact that you are learning every time you build something, and that you are constantly on a journey of discovering the best ways to be a developer, and share those insights with others.</p><p>This gives people a great insight into how your mind works and what kind of a developer you will be.</p><p>By consistently creating content like this and getting it in front of the intentional connections you've been making, you can start to build a profile for yourself that will help you stand out among other new developers.</p><p>Slowly, you'll start to have people reaching out to you who are interested in hiring you. And then when you start to see job openings show up for these companies, you will already be on their radar as someone who is competent.</p><p>The key to coming up with great content is to learn to see inspiration everywhere. As you are browsing Twitter, working on projects, reading articles, listening to podcasts, and so on, start writing down content inspiration and ideas you have.</p><p>Then, set aside some time every week to write your content for the week and try to post a new piece of content every day.</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2><p>By following these steps you will drastically increase your chances of being found on LinkedIn and building new relationships with people in the industry.</p><p>It's not a magic bullet, but it is one piece of a strong job-hunting strategy and an important piece of the puzzle when hunting for that first job, which can be very challenging.</p><p>For the rest of the roadmap, <a href=\"https://lever.so\">Lever.so</a> can help.

developer:</p><p><strong>I can't get a job without experience, but I can't get any experience without a job!</strong></p><p>It's something we all feel at the beginning of our journeys. It can be frustrating and seemingly impossible to escape when we keep getting rejection after rejection or we're outright ignored.</p><p>Plus, we constantly see job postings for entry-level devs with 2-3 years of experience, however that's supposed to work.</p><p>So, what can you do to establish your credibility as a brand new developer with no existing experience?</p><h2 id=\"understand-why-companies-value-experience\">Understand Why Companies Value Experience</h2><p>Start by putting yourself in the company's shoes.</p><p>This can do wonders for understanding why people do and don't get hired, and it can help you to not take things too personally when getting ignored or rejected.</p><p>Every hiring decision is a risk assessment. Will this person bring more value to the company than it will cost to hire them?</p><p>Your job is to convince the employer that the answer to that question is yes.</p><p>The difficulty is that existing experience is a massive signal towards that equation being true.</p><p>Someone with no experience is a risky hire.</p><p>So you need to create your own signals that can lower your perceived level of risk to the employer.</p><p>Also keep in mind that it doesn't just come down to raw skills.</p><p>Hiring decisions are made by humans, and it is very possible to overcome a lack of experience with personality traits like enthusiasm, showing genuine interest in working for this specific company, and the initiative to build things on your own.</p><p>All of these things are wrapped up in building credibility.</p><h2 id=\"a-two-part-formula-for-gaining-credibility\">A Two-Part Formula for Gaining Credibility</h2><p><strong>Credibility = Proven Skills + Visibility</strong></p><p>In order to establish our credibility we need to demonstrate that we have valuable skills, and we need to get the right people to see those skills.</p><p>It's important to reiterate here that I don't just mean hard skills.</p><p>Being able to build an app in JavaScript is one thing, and an undeniably important part of being a good developer, but your soft skills are just as important.</p><p>You need to not only have excellent communication skills, great motivation, be a self-starter, and so on, but you need to effectively communicate that you have those qualities to potential employers.</p><p>Just saying it is not effective – everybody does that. You need to show it.</p><p>So you need to not only demonstrate your hard coding skills, you also need to demonstrate that you know how to best utilize those skills in order to bring value to a company.</p><p>This is the kind of credibility that will convince someone to take a chance and hire you, even with no experience.</p><p>There are three main components to doing this successfully:</p><ol><li>Building</li><li>Writing</li><li>Connecting</li></ol><p>Let's go through each of these and then wrap up by seeing how we can effectively combine them to set ourselves apart as credible, competent developers even when we have no work experience.</p><h2 id=\"build-projects-with-your-tech-stack\">Build Projects With Your Tech Stack</h2><p>Being able to build real things in your tech stack of choice is obviously a huge component here. If the company you are applying to doesn't see any technical skill, it's a non-starter, you aren't getting that job.</p><p>But there is some nuance here.</p><p>I've heard of lots of developers getting hired for a role they weren't completely technically qualified for because of their character traits and the potential seen in them.</p><p>So there is a balance to find here between making sure you prove you are technically competent enough while not thinking it is the only thing that matters (or even the most important thing).</p><p>The best way to show that you have the right technical skills is to build unique things that don't exist yet.</p><p>Building something by following a course or tutorial only shows that you are capable of learning and following directions, but it does not show that you understand how to solve a complex, unique problem from the ground up.</p><p>That is the kind of technical skills companies are looking for. Skills that can be applied to solve real problems faced by real people, since that is what you will ultimately be paid for.</p><p>What I recommend people do here is find a good course that teaches a tech stack they are interested in.</p><p>Courses and tutorials are fantastic for being introduced to a tech stack and (this is very important) learning the best practices of that stack.</p><p>But they are not always good for real, practical learning of how to actually build valuable things.</p><p>So I recommend finding a good course teaching your tech stack, following it, and then coming up with your own project to build using it.</p><p>As you are building it, document what you are doing and why, which brings us to the next component of our credibility-building framework.</p><h2 id=\"write-about-what-you-build-and-learn\">Write About What You Build and Learn</h2><p>Writing has a few major benefits.</p><p>First, it allows you to get clear on your ideas and processes. Writing things down forces you to get as clear and concise as possible in your thinking and your methods.</p><p>Plus, writing forces you to get clear on your process because you have to take something out of your brain and get it down onto paper (or screen) for someone else to understand.</p><p>This is easier said than done, but is going to be one of the things that can set you apart in the job hunt.</p><p>Not only that, but you will be expected to be able to communicate effectively when you start working as a professional dev.</p><p>Writing not only helps to prove that you can do that, but gives you a way to practice so that you can do it as effectively as possible.</p><h3 id=\"a-simple-system-for-writing\">A Simple System for Writing</h3><p>Writing can often be challenging, especially if you are new to it.</p><p>I love writing, do it all the time, and it is still difficult for me sometimes.</p><p>So I want to give you a simple method to get started writing today that you can adjust and build on as you start to practice and get better.</p><h4 id=\"set-aside-time-to-write-each-day\">Set aside time to write each day</h4><p>This has been really important for me in order to not only make sure I'm consistent, but also to actually improve my writing.</p><p>One of the things that I have found through writing numerous articles is that in order to uncover the good writing I have to write through the crappy writing.</p><p>Sitting around waiting for inspiration to strike is not the way to go about this. You need to just start writing. Once you start, you'll be surprised at how the words start to flow.</p><p>But that flow won't happen until you start.</p><p>So set aside however much time you can each day to just write.</p><p>Note: Writing is not editing. Those should be two separate tasks, more on this below.</p><h4 id=\"write-from-the-perspective-of-a-teacher\">Write from the perspective of a teacher</h4><p>I see a lot of new developers writing \"I learned this\" or \"I worked on this today\" style blog posts and tweets.</p><p>While these are great, writing from the perspective of someone teaching these things does more for your credibility.</p><p>For example, say you are working on being a Front-End Developer and are focusing on React, and you are in the middle of creating a meal-planning app.</p><p>Rather than write a blog post about how you learned different things about React, write about \"How to Build a Meal Planning App in React\".</p><p>The shift is a subtle one, but coming at the writing from a position of authority will do wonders for your credibility and how your skill levels are perceived.</p><p>I suspect a lot of the reason people are hesitant to do this is that they are new and don't feel as if they can write from a position of authority.</p><p>But if you have accomplished something, you <em>can</em> write from a position of authority to anyone who desires to do the same thing but has not done it yet.</p><p>Plus, writing this way shows that you not only have the skills to do it, but that you have confidence in those skills, very attractive to potential employers.</p><h4 id=\"keep-a-running-list-of-ideas\">Keep a running list of ideas</h4><p>The way I avoid writer's block is by having a running list of ideas. Every time an idea pops into my head, I simply add a brief description of it to my ideas list.</p><p>Every time I sit down to write, I am either writing my current piece, or choosing the next idea from the list.</p><p>This also eliminates getting stuck because of decision overwhelm.</p><p>You don't have to think about what to write, you simply choose the next idea and start writing.</p><p>If you cannot think of any ideas, write a tutorial-style blog post walking through whatever project you are currently working on.</p><h4 id=\"separate-writing-and-editing\">Separate writing and editing</h4><p>This was a big shift for me.</p><p>I would constantly pause during my writing, rethink things, and edit on the fly.</p><p>Now I separate writing and editing into two distinct processes.</p><p>When I am writing, I am just writing.</p><p>I don't overthink it, I don't pause, I don't second guess my words, I just write.</p><p>Then after I feel like I've said everything I have to say, I will leave the piece and not look at it at least overnight.</p><p>The next day, I come at it with fresh eyes and edit it.</p><h4 id=\"write-about-more-than-just-technical-things\">Write about more than just technical things</h4><p>Since you're a developer, you might think that you should focus on writing development-specific topics.</p><p>But I would encourage you to venture outside of that zone a bit and write about other things that can relate back to development.</p><p>Companies ultimately hire people, not code. And people can fit in well or poorly at certain companies.</p><p>Your writing can give potential employers a glimpse into how you work and think, which can go a long way to making you stand out to them before they even speak to you.</p><p>For example, you may want to write about why you love coding, what motivates you to do great work, how you decompress outside of work hours to make sure that you can continue to do your best work.</p><p>All of these things ultimately relate to you working as a developer, but they are not overtly technical in nature.</p><h2 id=\"connect-with-people-in-the-tech-community\">Connect with People in the Tech Community</h2><p>Connecting with others is the final piece of the credibility puzzle.</p><p>It is often the thing that developers see as being the major shift in what kinds of opportunities come their way.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's also sometimes the most difficult to actually start implementing.</p><p>This has a silver lining though. Because it is uncomfortable to do, most people won't do it.</p><p>That means there is an excellent opportunity for you to use it as a way to stand out among other developers.</p><p>Your portfolio projects and writing have created a solid online presence for you to build off of. Now it's time to amplify that by building up a strong network of people.</p><p>My two favorite tools for this are LinkedIn and Twitter.</p><p>The ultimate goal is to build up a network of people so that you don't ever have to look for work. You can simply reach out to your network to find something that's a good fit.</p><p>This takes a lot of time, but is the ultimate goal of building a network.</p><p>For now, the goal is to increase your visibility and make it known you are looking for work. This way people will notice you, come across the foundation you've built with your portfolio and writing, and you'll stand out.</p><p>Here's what I recommend you do to increase your visibility by connecting with others.</p><p>We're not going to make this awkward or try and throw ourselves at people. We're simply going to reach out to people who work for companies we admire and show genuine interest in their company.</p><p>Start by making a list of 10 companies you would love to work for.</p><p>Then find 2 or 3 people at each of those companies that have positions similar to what you would like to do.</p><p>Connect with them on LinkedIn and follow them on Twitter if you can (not everyone will have these accounts).</p><p>Then simply send them a message following this template:</p><ul><li>Short introduction.</li><li>Thing you admire about the company.</li><li>Simple, easy-to-answer question you have for them.</li></ul><p>Here's how this might look if I wanted to work at Ghost.</p><blockquote>Hi there! My name is Ken. I'm a self-taught Ember developer and absolutely love what Ghost is doing for the indie publishing industry. Your recently launched Membership feature is a game-changer! As a front-end dev at Ghost, what's the most rewarding aspect of working on a product with such a bold mission?</blockquote><p>Note you are not asking for a job here, you're just initiating a conversation and starting a relationship.</p><p>It's short, to the point, and asks a question that you cannot get by Googling something.</p><p>This example works because I actually admire this about Ghost. Your admiration and desire to work for the company should be real. People are great at smelling deception from a mile a way and it will backfire on you.</p><p>Again, the goal here is not to hard-sell yourself for a job, it's to initiate a conversation and build a relationship.</p><p>Doing this consistently with different people and different companies will take you a long way.</p><p>Your goal should be to reach out to one new person like this every day.</p><p>As you start to build conversations with people, you can take the conversation further and perhaps meet with them in person or over video and discuss your career goals.</p><p>This is how you build a network of people that can bring you great opportunities as they present themselves.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-combine-these-strategies-into-a-cohesive-system\">How to Combine These Strategies into a Cohesive System</h2><p>Now that you know the necessary components, it's time to quickly go over how we can effectively combine them into a system that we can execute on every day.</p><p>My favorite method for doing this is time-blocking.</p><p>Figure out how much time you can dedicate to this each day depending on your schedule.</p><p>Then chunk out that time block into thirds.</p><p>The first is for building, the second for writing, and the third for connecting.</p><p>For the first third of your time, you should be working on your current personal project.</p><p>For the second, write about the project you are working on or another current problem you are facing if your project doesn't facilitate writing well.</p><p>An excellent way to come up with things to write about is to treat your writing as public therapy.</p><p>Work through whatever current problem you are facing by writing it down, then go back and edit it and publish it.</p><p>Finally, the remaining third of your time should be spent researching companies and people and reaching out to one of them.</p><p>The steps outlined here may seem simple, and they are, but they are powerful.</p><p>Taking simple but powerful actions like this consistently is how you build an excellent career from the ground up, regardless of your existing background.</p><p>If you are currently working towards getting your first job as a professional developer, I think you'll love <a href=\"https://lever.so\">Lever.so</a>, a step-by-step course and mentoring group designed to help you land your first job.</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

can't control the actions of those around us, we can only control our own. So rather than drowning ourselves in the negative, let's focus on what we can do to improve ourselves, improving the world around us in the process.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-a-new-year-time-to-make-some-changes\">It's a New Year - Time to Make Some Changes</h2><p>And so here we are in 2021 with a new opportunity to do something amazing. I don't know what it is about a new year, but something about that calendar change spurs motivation in people.</p><p>The new year motivation surge has never made any logical sense to me, and yet I can't help but feel the same thing.</p><p>Logical or not, the new year provides an excellent opportunity to take advantage of the psychological quirks that make us human in order to do something life-changing.</p><p>But New Year's Resolutions are fickle, fleeting things. Rather than trying to implement a vast, sweeping change based on temporary motivation, let's use this motivation to instill some sustainable habits that can translate into launching and growing a successful development career.</p><p>Then when the initial motivation inevitably wanes, we have already established simple but high-leverage habits that are easy to stick to.</p><p>This is the way I recommend that new and aspiring developers launch their careers in 2021: by focusing on small, high-leverage, daily actions.</p><p>These daily habits should revolve around one key principle of building a successful career:</p><p><strong>Building valuable skills and convincing others you possess those skills.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, every hiring decision boils down to this.</p><p>That can be hard to do as a new developer with no experience. The key is making yourself stand out among the sea of other developers in the exact same position as you.</p><p>In this post, we'll go through a step-by-step process for doing exactly this, regardless of your current level of experience or education.</p><p>We'll do this in 5 phases:</p><ol><li>Getting Your Mindset Right</li><li>Building An Online Presence</li><li>Creating Valuable Things</li><li>Connecting with People</li><li>Pitching Yourself</li></ol><p>Let's do this.</p><p>Necessary disclaimer: This advice is from my personal experience combined with what I have seen around me and heard from others over the last 6 years of being a software developer. </p><p>I am not saying this is the only way to do things or else you will fail, but it's perhaps a different way of doing things than a lot of people are doing.</p><p>I'm seeing a lot of people feeling burnt out and discouraged not being able to find a job, so I wanted to offer some advice. Hopefully, it helps some of you who are currently struggling to land that first job and feeling hopeless.</p><h2 id=\"first-get-your-mind-right\">First, get your mind right</h2><p>This is often overlooked, but it's so important. As a new dev with no experience, you have to find other ways to make yourself stand out. It is very, very difficult to stand out when you are simply submitting your resume and application just like everyone else with no context.</p><p>Going this route, you are leaving everything up to chance and hoping that your resume or application will happen to stick out to whoever is reviewing them.</p><p>As a piece of circumstantial/anecdotal evidence to support this, I recommend giving Josh Comeau's <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/career/no-cs-degree-required/\">post on getting hired without a degree</a> a read.</p><p>He polled his Twitter followers and found that around 85% of them did not get their job by submitting endless applications. They got their job because of a portfolio of side projects, their network, and their personality.</p><p>So the key here is to leverage those things in order to make yourself stand out. How do you do that? We'll get into that in the next sections.</p><p>Before that, it's also important to note that most companies do not hire junior devs for their current skills, they hire them for their potential skills.</p><p>The most important thing you can do as an aspiring junior dev is show that you have the ability to learn, that you are eager and hungry to learn, and that you are capable of being taught and coached.</p><p>Your personality matters just as much, if no more, than your raw coding abilities at this stage, so you need to make sure you let that part shine and make yourself stand out.</p><h2 id=\"next-get-your-online-presence-in-order\">Next, get your online presence in order</h2><p>When I say online presence, I mean GitHub, LinkedIn, your personal portfolio site, and somewhere to write. This could either be a platform like <a href=\"https://dev.to\">DEV</a> or your own site. But if it's your own site, make it a separate area from your portfolio.</p><p>Choose a high-quality headshot and use it across these platforms.</p><p>For GitHub, it should be filled out completely and show that you are active frequently. Your projects should also have well-structured and thought-out READMEs. Put in that little bit of extra effort that shows you really care about what you are doing.</p><p>Refer to the following excellent sources for setting up a good LinkedIn profile and building a great portfolio site.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://dev.to/exampro/linkedin-is-for-losers-think-again-from-100k-to-200k-job-opportunities-hacks-included-1a8e\">How to get the most out of your LinkedIn profile </a></li><li><a href=\"https://dev.to/exampro/700-web-developers-asked-me-to-give-them-linkedin-profile-feedback-and-these-are-my-5-top-tips-5382\">Top 5 tips for creating a great LinkedIn profile</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/\">hHow to build an effective developer portfolio</a></li></ul><p>As far as writing, write about what you are currently working on from the perspective of a teacher. So, instead of writing about \"I'm learning to build a meal planning app\", write \"How to Build a Meal Planning App with React and GraphQL\".</p><p>You can make it a multi-part series and write as you are building it, making sure to write about technical hurdles you are overcoming.</p><p>Injecting your personality into your writing is also huge. Don't feel like it has to be all technical – write about why you like to code, what it means to you, where you get your drive from, those kinds of things.</p><h2 id=\"then-build-real-things-that-solve-real-problems\">Then, build real things that solve real problems</h2><p>This is another change in the approach that can have a huge impact. Instead of building simple apps by following a tutorial or a course, build something completely unique that solves a real problem for you or someone else.</p><p>If you can't think of anything, ask the people close to you what their biggest struggles or annoyances are day-to-day. Then start learning to see tech-based solutions to problems you encounter.</p><p>Next, write about the process of finding that problem, discovering the solution, and building the solution.</p><p>Yes, this is more work and much harder than following something written and built by someone else. But it is what you'll be doing when you get hired and is massively impressive to potential employers.</p><p>Ultimately you will not be hired to code, you will be hired to solve problems. Code is just the mechanism you use.</p><h2 id=\"after-that-start-networking\">After that, start networking</h2><p>Your online presence won't do you much good if nobody sees it. So now is the time to start reaching out to others and building up a network of people. Find companies and people you admire and connect with them on LinkedIn or Twitter, or even directly by email.</p><p>These can be simple emails or DMs like: </p><blockquote>\"Hey, my name is Ken. I'm an aspiring React developer and saw that you guys [made this cool thing/contributed to this cool cause, etc]. <br><br>I really admire your [work/culture/cause/whatever thing about them you admire]. I'm new to development, but am eager to learn and someday contribute to a great team. <br><br>As a company that does [thing you admire] well, what's the #1 thing you look for when hiring a junior dev? Looking forward to learning from you! Ken\"</blockquote><p>This email isn't meant to get you a job, it's meant to be a quick message you can send to start building a relationship. Try to send one of these every day to start building real relationships with people in the field you admire.</p><p>Connect with other developers, potential employers, and recruiters on LinkedIn every day. Start engaging and commenting on their content, plus writing content of your own on what you are learning and insights you are having.</p><p>Your goal here is to get on their radar and stay there.</p><h2 id=\"finally-do-your-research-and-start-pitching-yourself\">Finally, do your research and start pitching yourself</h2><p>Ultimately, the goal is to have a portfolio and network strong enough that you have opportunities coming to you, but that can take time.</p><p>Pitching is my favorite short-term way of making yourself stand out among a sea of other people.</p><p>Keep an open mind about this. A lot of people find this awkward or cheesy, but it does wonders for catching the attention of someone and proving you have the ambition and drive to do good work for them.</p><p>Here's how it works:</p><p>Find 10 or so companies you really admire and would really love to work for. They don't necessarily have to be hiring for your position, but it's a bonus if they are.</p><p>Do some research on them, find out what their values are, what is important to them, and what kinds of work they do. Try to identify potential gaps in their work that you might be able to help fill, or simply contribute to helping fill if they are already working on it.</p><p>Then, record a quick video pitch. Try to keep it to under 3 minutes, 2 is ideal. In the pitch, quickly introduce yourself, tell them why you want to work for them specifically, and tell them what value you can bring to their team. Talk about your skillset and your ambition.</p><p>Finally, reference a project that is relevant to the work they do. If possible, build a small micro-project that aligns with their vision and goals. I realize not everyone has the bandwidth to do this, but it's great if you can.</p><p>Create a dedicated page on your portfolio site that has all this stuff on it, and send it directly to the person in charge of hiring when you submit your application. Or just send it straight to them if they are not currently hiring.</p><p>The goal is to make yourself stand out as someone that is passionate about working for them specifically. You want to prove that you either have the skills necessary to do so, or are willing and capable of learning them.</p><h2 id=\"turn-it-into-a-system\">Turn it into a system</h2><p>This is all well and good, but I started this post by saying we need to instill small but high-leverage habits and try to be consistent with them.</p><p>So far I've given you a lot fo information, now let's distill it into daily and weekly actions you can take to actually make this happen.</p><h3 id=\"step-1-set-aside-create-time-and-connect-time\">Step 1 - Set aside create time and connect time</h3><p>Ultimately these strategies boil down to creating things and connecting with people. Now that you have a good online presence set up, it's time to get started on the rest. </p><p>So look at your schedule, see how much time you can dedicate to each, and block it out in whatever calendar you use.</p><p>There's no reason to dedicate more than 30 minutes to connecting time, so once you fill that up, assign the rest of your time to creating, which includes building things and writing about them, and pitching, which can follow the process we outlined above.</p><p>If you don't yet have your online presence set up and optimized, that is what you should focus on for your create time.</p><p>Get a project or two up and your online presence up, that way you actually have something to show people.</p><p>The first thing you need to do is actually learn some dev skills and demonstrate them. Go through freeCodeCamp or another learning resource, and start building immediately, as you are learning. Do not wait until you complete something or \"feel ready\" to start building your own things.</p><p>Build now.</p><p>You don't have to set aside hours a day if you can't. Set aside what time you can, keep it sacred, and focus everything you have on building in that time.</p><p>So, right now you should have two time blocks in your calendar, for creating and connecting.</p><p>In that connect time, you should be reaching out to one person vie email or social media, and connecting with potential employers, other devs, and recruiters on LinkedIn.</p><p>Be sure to limit this time to 30 minutes so you don't get sucked into the social media rabbit hole.</p><h3 id=\"step-2-add-in-pitch-time\">Step 2 - Add in pitch time</h3><p>Once you have a real-world project or two up, your portfolio site built, and your online presence optimized, then you can start pitching.</p><p>Add a pitch block to your calendar. You can either make this part of your connect time or cut into your create time, whichever works better for you.</p><p>During this pitch time, follow the steps I laid out above in order.</p><p>Find your 10 companies and do your research on them. Then go through one-by-one and craft and send your pitch.</p><p>If you follow this simple two-step process every day, continue to work on your skills and cultivate the right soft skills like ambition, humility, and effective communication, I am absolutely sure you will be able to find a job.</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h2><p>This has been a long post, but hopefully it has given you an idea or two for how you can increase the effectiveness of your job hunt.</p><p>Again, this is not meant to say this is the only way. But I see a lot of people out there saying it's just a numbers game and you have to just apply and hope for the best. That's not necessarily true.</p><p>There is an element of luck to this, but having a good strategy and focusing on ways to make yourself stand out can go a long way towards maximizing any luck that does come your way.</p><p>If you are currently trying to get your first job as a developer, <a href=\"https://lever.so\">Lever</a> can help you make it happen.
