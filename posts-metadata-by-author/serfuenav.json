Some of its most prominent features are:</p><ul><li>Container configuration and deployment</li><li>System monitoring</li><li>Persistent storage</li><li>Automated scheduling</li><li>Auto-scaling and auto-healing</li></ul><p>And much more.</p><p>Kubernetes works in a <strong>declarative</strong> fashion: you define the state you want in your cluster and Kubernetes works to make sure the cluster is always on that state. </p><p>To define or modify this state, you need to interact with the API server. This can be done via:</p><ul><li>REST calls</li><li>The command line tool <code>kubectl</code>. You can find instructions to install it on your machine <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/\">here</a>.</li></ul><p>If you don't have access to a Kubernetes cluster, I suggest installing <a href=\"https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/\">minikube</a> on your local machine to follow along. Once installed and started, run the following command to create your first pod.</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">kubectl run --image=busybox --restart=Never --rm -it -- echo \"Welcome to Kubernetes!!\"\n</code></pre><p>This pod will be deleted automatically once it prints its welcome message.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-clusters-in-kubernetes\">How to Manage Clusters in Kubernetes</h2><p>Cluster management is not part of the curriculum to become a CKAD. For the purposes of the exam, you don't need to know how to create a cluster, manage nodes, and so on. </p><p>And unless you're planning to become a cluster administrator, chances you will just be a user of a managed version of Kubernetes in the cloud, like GKE on GCP or EKS on AWS.</p><p>However, you must familiarize yourself with the concepts of namespace, labels, and annotations.</p><h3 id=\"namespaces\">Namespaces</h3><p>Namespaces allow you to create <em>virtual clusters</em>, this is, to segregate resources in different sections of the same physical cluster. For example:</p><ul><li>To separate different environments like development, stage, QA, and production</li><li>To break down a complex system into smaller subsystems. You can create a namespace for front-end components, another for back-end components, and so on.</li><li>To avoid name collision: the same resource can be created with the same name in different namespaces. This make it easy to create different environments (think stage and prod) that look identical.</li></ul><p>You can create a namespace by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl create ns my-namespace\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"resource-quotas\">Resource Quotas</h3><p>If you want to limit the amount of resources that developers can create in a namespace (both physical resources and Kubernetes objects like pods) you can use <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/\">Resource Quotas</a>.</p><p>For instance, you can limit the number of Kubernetes <em>secrets</em> that users can create on your cluster by defining the following <code>ResourceQuota</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: ResourceQuota\nmetadata:\n  name: my-quota\nspec:\n  hard:\n    secrets: \"2\"\n</code></pre><p>in a file – let's call it <code>my-quota.yaml</code> – and then running <code>kubectl apply -f my-quota.yaml</code> or simply running</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl create quota my-quota --hard=\"secrets=2\"\n</code></pre><p>More on <em>secrets</em> later on in the guide.</p><h3 id=\"labels\">Labels</h3><p>Labels allow you to organize resources inside your Kubernetes cluster. A label is a key-value pair that you attach to a resource, either when you create it or by labeling an existing resource. You can then use labels to filter resources. </p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>You want to display only your <code>backend</code> pods. You can attach the label <code>tier=backed</code> to the pods (both the key and the value are arbitrary, you can use whatever you want) and then run <code>kubectl get pods -l tier=backend</code> to retrieve the desired pods.</li><li>You want to define a deployment or a service associated with certain pods. The way to tell the deployment/service which pods it needs to keep an eye on is by using labels to select them.</li></ul><p>Here are some common label-related actions:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Labeling a pod, but similar syntax for nodes, etc\nkubectl label pods pod-name key=value\n# Removing a label by podname\nkubectl label pods pod-name label_key-\n\n# Removing a pod using the label as selector\nkubectl label po -l app app-\n\n# Display labels\nkubectl get pods --show-labels\n\n# Select pods based on their labels (assume we've defined)\nkubect get pods -l 'tier in (frontend,backend)'\nkubect get pods -l tier=frontend,deployer=coolest-team\n</code></pre><p>Annotations are similar to labels in that they're key-value pairs, but they cannot be used to select resources. They have a different purpose. </p><p>Annotations are normally added to be processed by other tools. For example, if you're running Prometheus to gather metrics, you could add this configuration to your descriptor:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">metadata:\n\tlabels:\n\t\tname: fluentd-elasticsearch\n\tannotations:\n        prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'\n        prometheus.io/port: '9102'\n</code></pre><p>It tells Prometheus to override the default values for <em>scrape</em> and <em>port</em> with <code>true</code> and <code>9102</code> respectively.</p><h2 id=\"beyond-pods-and-deployments\">Beyond Pods and Deployments</h2><p>As you know by now, a <strong>pod</strong> is the basic unit in Kubernetes. In most cases, you can think of it as a container but a pod can consist of multiple containers. Since pods are ephemeral in nature, we need a mechanism to make sure new pods are created when our existing pods die.</p><p>With deployments you can define a desired state, for example having 3 replicas of your application always running. Kubernetes will work towards achieving and keeping this state in the cluster at all times. </p><p>Deployments can also be used to easily manage the number of replicas running at any time, perform rolling updates, roll back to previous versions, and so on.</p><p>However, there are many more workloads.</p><h3 id=\"multi-container-pods\">Multi-container pods</h3><p>A pod can run more than one container. Containers can talk to each other seamlessly, because they are in the same network and they can use <em>volumes</em> to share data.</p><p>For now, let's dive into some common design patterns for multi-container pods. Later in this guide we'll see volumes in detail and how to deploy some of these patterns.</p><h4 id=\"sidecar\">Sidecar</h4><p>In this pattern we have a container that runs your main application along with another container that <strong>runs secondary tasks to enhance your main container</strong>.</p><p>A classical example is running a web server (main container) along with a side container that handles tasks like logging, monitoring, refreshing data in the pod volume, terminating TLS, and so on.</p><h4 id=\"adapter\">Adapter</h4><p>Similarly, you can have your main container and a secondary container that <strong>transforms the output of the main one</strong>.</p><p>For example, imagine your main container runs a service that outputs a lot of complex logs. You can use an adapter container to simplify this output before it gets sent to your logging service, offloading the main container (and the developers of the service) from this task.</p><h4 id=\"ambassador\">Ambassador</h4><p>Another common option is to use a secondary container <strong>to act as a proxy</strong> between your main container and the external world.</p><p>For instance, you probably have different databases for different environments, like testing and production. When your main container needs a connection to a database, it can offload to the ambassador container the task of figuring out the appropriate database depending on the environment.</p><h3 id=\"services\">Services</h3><p>Pods can connect other pods using their IP addresses. However, pods are ephemeral by nature. When they die, assuming you have a replication controller, a new pod will be created with a new IP address. This makes it hard use IPs to connect to pods directly.</p><p>Kubernetes offers an abstraction called Service that creates <strong>a resource with a fixed IP address</strong> and send requests to the appropriate pods. </p><p>Instead of connecting to the pods directly, you can reach their service via its IP address or even better using its fully qualified name thanks to the DNS service. Furthermore, some types of services expose you application outside the cluster too.</p><h4 id=\"types-of-services\">Types of Services</h4><p>The main type of services you can create are:</p><ul><li><strong>ClusterIP –</strong> To expose your application inside the cluster. This is the default service that Kubernetes creates if you don't specify a type.</li><li><strong>NodePort –</strong> It opens a port on every node in the cluster to expose your applications to the world.</li><li><strong>LoadBalancer –</strong> Exposes a service externally using a cloud provider load balancer.</li></ul><h4 id=\"how-to-expose-your-application-inside-the-cluster\">How to expose your application inside the cluster</h4><p>Let's say you want to expose your application <code>my-app</code> to other nodes in the cluster on port 80. You could you create a <em>deployment</em> that deploys your application with this command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl create deploy my-app --image=my-app --port=80\n</code></pre><p>This will create pods that can only be accessed from other resources inside the cluster by their IP, which will change if the pods restart.</p><p>The next step is to create a ClusterIP service for these pods. The following command creates a service that can be reached at port 80 and will forward the requests to your application (also at port 80).</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl expose deploy my-app --port=80\n</code></pre><h4 id=\"how-to-expose-your-application-outside-the-cluster\">How to expose your application outside the cluster</h4><p>If you wanted to expose you application to the world instead, you could use this configuration to create a NodePort service:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">kind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n\tname: my-svc\nspec:\n    type: NodePort\n    selector:\n\t    app: nginx\n    ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n    \tport: 80 # The port where you can reach this service\n    \ttargetPort: 80 # The port that you opened in the pod\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"ingress\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">Ingress</a></h3><p>Services are not the only way to expose your applications to the world. You can also use an <strong>Ingress object</strong> as an entry point for your cluster. </p><p>In addition to this, you need an <strong>Ingress Controller</strong>, like Nginx, to implement the rules defined in the Ingress object.</p><p>Since ingresses are out of the scope of the CKAD, we will move onto other topics.</p><h3 id=\"jobs\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a></h3><p>A Job will create one or several pods that will <strong>not be restarted if they complete successfully</strong>. You can use a them to perform batch jobs, that is, <strong>one-off tasks</strong> like carrying out a calculation, backing up some files, transforming and exporting some data, and so on.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise, the pod will run once. You can specify how many times a job needs to be run to be considered COMPLETED, using the parameter <code>completions</code>. By default, pods will run sequentially but you can set up the Job so that they run in parallel.</p><p>In case they don't complete successfully, you can configure them to either <code>Never</code> restart (try again) or to restart <code>OnFailure</code> up to <code>backoffLimit</code> times before Kubernetes considers that the job has failed.</p><p>Here's how to create a simple job from the command line:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"> kubectl create job my-job --image=busybox -- echo \"Hello World\"\n</code></pre><p>If they job ran successfully, its state will be COMPLETED and its pod(s) won't be deleted so that you can access their logs. You can see them using:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectll get pods --show-all\n</code></pre><p>since by default they won't be visible in they default list of pods after 2 minutes.</p><h3 id=\"cronjobs\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/\">Cronjobs</a></h3><p>Kubernetes offers Conjobs to create jobs that need to run periodically or at a specific time in the future: periodical cleanup and backup tasks, renewal of TLS certificates, and so on.</p><p>Kubernetes will try its best to run only one Job to perform the task you specified in the Cronjob configuration. However, there are 3 common issues that you should be aware of:</p><ul><li>It is not guaranteed that the job will run <strong>exactly at the desired time</strong>. Imagine you need your job to run at 09:00:00. You can set the <code>startingDeadlineSeconds</code> property to X seconds so that, if the job has not started by 09:00:00 + X seconds, it will be marked as failed and not run.</li><li><strong>2 Jobs might be scheduled at the same time</strong> to perform the task. In this case, you need to make sure that the tasks are <em>idempotent</em>, this is, the result of executing the task won't change if the task is carried out multiple times.</li><li><strong>No jobs might be scheduled</strong>. To overcome this issue, make sure the Cronjob picks up any work undone by the previous run.</li></ul><p>This is how you create a simple cronjob that prints \"Hello World\" every minute:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl create cronjob my-job --image=busybox --schedule=\"*/1 * * * *\" -- echo \"Hello World\"\n</code></pre><p>I recommend this <a href=\"https://crontab.guru/\">website</a> to get your cron schedule expressions right.</p><p>The next 3 resources are not part of the CKAD exam, but I think you should have a basic understanding of them at least.</p><h3 id=\"daemon-sets\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/\">Daemon sets</a></h3><p>Daemon sets ensure that a pod is scheduled in every <strong>node</strong> of your cluster. In addition to this, the pod is always up and running: if it dies or if someone deletes it, the pod will be recreated.</p><p>A common use case for Daemon sets is to collect logs and metrics that come from each node. But even if you don't create any, they are already some daemon sets running in your cluster: Kubernetes creates a daemon set to run a component called <code>kube-proxy</code> in every node!</p><p>If you remove a node from the cluster, Kubernetes will not recreate its daemon in another node, because this node will already be running the daemon set. If you add a new node to the cluster, it will automatically run the daemon set.</p><h3 id=\"stateful-set\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/\">Stateful set</a></h3><p>So far, we have seen tools to deploy stateless applications or pods that have their own persistent storage that will outlive them. To deploy stateful applications you can use stateful sets.</p><p>Since this is not part of the CKAD exam, we will not get into more details.</p><h3 id=\"static-pods\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod/\">Static pods</a></h3><p>Static pods are pods managed by <code>kubelet</code>, not by the Kubernetes API.</p><p>To create them, you just need to create a regular pod configuration file and configure kubelet to scan that directory. After you restart <code>kubelet</code> , it will create the pod and restart it if it fails.</p><p>Kubernetes will create a mirror pod, this is, a copy of the pod in the Kubernetes API server. You can see that this pod appears when you run <code>kubectl get pods</code>, but if you try to delete it using <code>kubectl delete podName</code> it will show up in the pod list immediately, created by the <code>kubelet</code> that runs in the node where you created the static pod.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-configure-pods-and-containers\">How to Configure Pods and Containers</h2><p>We have just seen different workloads that you can deploy on your Kubernetes cluster. Let's spend some time now learning how to configure the pods and containers that run these workloads.</p><h3 id=\"init-containers\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-initialization/\">Init Containers</a></h3><p>You can use <em>init containers</em> to set the initial state your pod: by writing some data to the pod's volume, downloading some files, and so on.</p><p>You can define one or more init containers for the same pod. They will be executed sequentially and the pod will only start running after all containers are done. Therefore, init containers can also be used to make the pod wait for a certain condition before it is executed. </p><p>For instance, you can make a pod wait for another service to be up and running before it can start.</p><p>You can define an init container by add the something like this under the <code>spec</code> section of your pod description:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">spec:\n  initContainers:\n  - name: init-myservice\n    image: busybox:1.28\n    command: ['sh', '-c', \"until nslookup myservice.$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace).svc.cluster.local; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done\"]\n ...\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"configmaps\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/\">ConfigMaps</a></h3><p>Keeping you application configuration separate from the source code is a practice you should follow. ConfigMaps allow you to do this in Kubernetes.</p><p>ConfigMaps are used to <strong>store key-value pairs of non-confidential data</strong>. We will see how to store confidential data (for example, passwords) in <em>Secrets</em> in the next section.</p><p>You can create a ConfigMap from the command line:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Passing the values as arguments\nkubectl create configmap my-map --from-literal=db_url=my-url --from-literal=username=username\n\n# Passing the values from a file\nkubectl create configmap another-map --from-file=my-file\n</code></pre><p>Once created, your application can use it in a pod that is in the same namespace in multiple ways:</p><ul><li>As command line arguments</li><li>As environment variables</li><li>From a file in a read-only volume</li></ul><p>Let's see a pod definition that reads values from a ConfigMap using these approaches:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n    - name: busybox\n      image: busybox\n      args:\n        - /bin/sh\n        - -c\n        - \"echo $MY_VARIABLE\" # This value comes from the configmap\n      env:\n      - name: MY_VARIABLE\n        valueFrom:\n          configMapKeyRef:\n            name: another-map           \n            key: my-key # To load individual keys from a map\n      envFrom:\n      - configMapRef:\n          name: another-map # To import all values from a map as env variables\n      volumeMounts:\n      - name: config\n        mountPath: \"/config\" # This will contain files with the data stored in my-map\n        readOnly: true\n  volumes:\n    # Name to refer to this volume in the pod\n    - name: config\n      configMap:\n        # Name of the ConfigMap\n        name: my-map\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"secrets\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\">Secrets</a></h3><p>Secrets are very similar to ConfigMaps, but you use them to store <strong>confidential data</strong>. Creating and managing secrets is a sensitive topic. Be sure to read the documentation. Here we'll see the basics.</p><p>The simplest way to create a secret is:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">#To create a secret from a literal\nkubectl create secret generic secret-name --from-literal=password=password\n#To create a secret from the content of a file\nkubectl create secret generic secret-name --from-file=path-to-file\n</code></pre><p>Then, you can mount your secrets into the pod as environment variables or files:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: another-pod\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n    - name: busybox\n      image: busybox\n      args:\n        - /bin/sh\n        - -c\n        - \"echo $MY_VARIABLE\"\n      env:\n      - name: MY_VARIABLE\n        valueFrom:\n          secretKeyRef:\n            name: my-secret2\n            key: username # To load individual keys from a map\n      envFrom:\n      - secretRef:\n          name: yet-another-secret # To import all values from a map as env variables\n      volumeMounts:\n      - name: secret-volume\n        mountPath: \"/secrets\" # This will contain files with the data stored in my-map\n        readOnly: true\n  volumes:\n    # Name to refer to this volume in the pod\n    - name: secret-volume\n      secret:\n        # Name of the Secret\n        secretName: my-secret\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"probes\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">Probes</a></h3><p>Probes allow you set rules to decide if a pod is healthy, if it is ready to serve traffic and if it is ready to start. At the end of this section I will present a sample descriptor with these some probes.</p><h4 id=\"liveness-probes\">Liveness probes</h4><p>Kubernetes will automatically restart <em>crashed containers</em>. However, this will not account for situations like bugs (imagine an infinite loop in your application), deadlocks, and so on. You can define liveness probes to <strong>detect whether your application is healthy</strong>. Kubernetes uses this probe to decide if it needs to restart the container.</p><p>There are three types of liveness probes you can define:</p><ul><li>HTTP Get, where you define an endpoint in your application (for example /health) that Kubernetes can hit to determine if the application is healthy.</li><li>TCP socket probe, that tries to establish a TCP connection to a specific port. If the connection cannot be established, the applications is restarted.</li><li>Exec probe, that runs a command inside the container and restarts it if the exit status code is different from 0.</li></ul><h4 id=\"readiness-probes\">Readiness probes</h4><p>Imagine a service that needs to load a large configuration file during startup. The container itself might be healthy (this can be checked using liveness probes described above) but not ready to start accepting requests. </p><p>Kubernetes uses readiness probes to determine if your application is ready to start serving traffic.</p><p>Many of the ideas discussed for liveness probes apply to readiness probes too:</p><ul><li>They can be configured with an initial delay, timeout, threshold, period, and so on</li><li>They can be based on HTTP get calls, TCP socket connections, or Execution of commands inside the container</li></ul><p>However, while liveness probes tell Kubernetes to restart the container if it is not healthy, readiness probes are used to remove the container from the pool of containers that can accept requests. Once the container is ready, it can start serving requests.</p><h4 id=\"startup-probes\">Startup probes</h4><p>Startup probes are used only during startup, for example for applications that are slow to start. If the startup probe succeeds, the liveness and readiness probes (if configured) will start running periodically.</p><h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3><p>This pod is going to execute the following commands:</p><ul><li>sleep 20</li><li>touch /tmp/healthy</li><li>sleep 30</li><li>rm -rf /tmp/healthy</li><li>sleep 600</li></ul><p>The most basic parameters you should be aware of when configuring your probes are:</p><ul><li><strong>initialDelaySeconds</strong> before starting to probe</li><li><strong>periodSeconds</strong> to define how often to probe</li><li><strong>timeoutSeconds</strong> after which the probe times out</li><li><strong>failureThreshold</strong> to determine the number of tries after which Kubernetes gives up</li></ul><p>With our configuration, the probes will start 10 seconds after the pod is created. During the first 20 seconds, the file <code>/tmp/healthy</code> does not exist. Therefore, the readiness probe will fail. We'll then create that file and for the next 30 seconds the readiness probe will succeed, until we remove the file again.</p><p>The liveness probe is a simple <code>echo \"I'm healthy\"</code> command. If it can be run, the pod is healthy. Otherwise, it needs to be restarted.</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - args:\n    - /bin/sh\n    - -c\n    - \"sleep 20; touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 600\"\n    image: busybox\n    name: tmp\n    livenessProbe:\n     exec: # If this command can be run, the pod is healthy\n       command:\n       - echo\n       - \"I'm healthy\"\n     initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Only start probing after 5 seconds\n     periodSeconds: 5 # Probe every 5 seconds\n    readinessProbe:\n     exec: # If this command can be run, the pod is ready to serve traffic\n       command:\n       - cat\n       - /tmp/healthy\n     initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Only start probing after 5 seconds\n     periodSeconds: 10 # Probe every 10 seconds\n  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst\n  restartPolicy: Never\nstatus: {}\n</code></pre><p>Execute this command to see the pod going through these states:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl get pods --watch\n</code></pre><p>See how the <code>Ready</code> column goes from <code>0/1</code>, to <code>1/1</code> and back to <code>0/.1</code>?</p><p>Run this command to get a list of events and see how the probes were failing, as we expected.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl describe pods my-pod\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"container-resources\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/\">Container Resources</a></h3><p>When you create a pod, you can define:</p><ul><li>The minimum amount of resources it needs to run, known as <em>requests</em>.</li><li>The maximum amount of resources the pod should use, known as <em>limits</em>.</li></ul><p>Kubernetes will take into account the resources you requested when it tries to schedule the pod. It will not schedule the pod in a node that hasn't got enough capacity, regardless of the current resource consumption. </p><p>For instance, if pods A and B are running in node N, Kubernetes will calculate if the new pod C can fit in N by doing something like:</p><p><code>Total capacity of N - (resources requested by A + resources requested by B) &lt;= resources requested by C</code></p><p>Even if pods A and B are not using all the resources they requested, Kubernetes <strong>promised</strong> they would have those resources available on that pod. That's why the current resource usage is not part of the previous formula.</p><p>If a pod goes over its resource limits, two things can happen:</p><ul><li>If it goes over its CPU limits, it will get throttled</li><li>If it goes over its memory limits, it will be restarted</li></ul><p>Let's now create a pod that requests some memory and CPU and limits the resources it is allowed to use:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: resource-limited-pod\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n    - name: busybox\n      image: busybox\n      args:\n        - /bin/sh\n        - -c\n        - \"echo Hello Kubernetes; sleep 3600\"\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          memory: \"300Mi\"\n          cpu: 0.2\n        limits:\n          memory: \"1Gi\"\n          cpu: 0.5\n</code></pre><p>As an exercise, set some ridiculously high values for the requested memory (and or CPU) and <em>try</em> to create the pod. You'll see that the pod never becomes ready. The output of</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl describe pods resource-limited-pod\n</code></pre><p>will tell you why.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-schedule-pods-in-kubernetes\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node\">How to Schedule Pods in Kubernetes</a> </h2><p>This section is not part of the curriculum for the CKAD exam. But I believe you should have at least some basic understanding of the concepts I'll expose here because they're likely to come up as you work with Kubernetes.</p><p>Kubernetes allows you to specify in which nodes you want your pods to be scheduled via multiple mechanisms. </p><p>The simplest one is to use the <strong>nodeSelector</strong> field to pick a node based on a label. However, other features have been introduced to allow for more complex setups.</p><h3 id=\"taints-and-tolerations\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/\">Taints and tolerations</a></h3><p>You can <strong>taint a node to prevent pods from being scheduled in it</strong>, without modifying the pods themselves. When you taint a node, the only pods that Kubernetes will schedule in that node will be the pods that <strong>tolerate</strong> that taint.</p><p>You can see this in action if you run:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl describe node master.Kubernetes\n</code></pre><p>In the output of the previous command, you will see the line:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">Taints: node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule\n</code></pre><p>This taint prevents pods from being scheduled in the master node (unless the pods tolerate this taint).</p><p>There are three types of taint:</p><ul><li>NoSchedule: Kubernetes will not schedule pods in a node if they cannot tolerate the taint.</li><li>PreferNoSchedule: pods that don't tolerate the taint won't be scheduled in a node unless they cannot be scheduled somewhere else.</li><li>NoExecute: if the pods <em>already running in the node</em> cannot tolerate the taint, evict them from the node.</li></ul><p><strong>Taints don't guarantee that pods will be scheduled in specific nodes</strong>. To achieve that, you need the concept of <em>Node affinity</em> that we will explore now.</p><h3 id=\"node-affinity\">Node affinity</h3><p>Node affinity tells Kubernetes to <strong>schedule pods to specific nodes</strong>.</p><p>Imagine you have a service S that needs special hardware to run. You want to dedicate the hardware to this service and only want pods from S to run on it. How can you achieve this?</p><p>You can taint the nodes that have this type of equipment so that only pods from service S can be scheduled in these nodes. However, Kubernetes can still deploy these pods in other nodes that don't have the required hardware.</p><p>We can see how the combination of taints and node affinity ensures that only pods from service S run in our specialized nodes:</p><ul><li>Node affinity schedules pods from S into the specialized nodes (and nowhere else).</li><li>Taints ensure that no other pods will be scheduled in the specialized nodes, only pods from service S.</li></ul><h2 id=\"storage-in-kubernetes\">Storage in Kubernetes</h2><p>By default, when the container inside a pod restarts, all the data inside the container is lost. This is by design. </p><p>If you want the data to outlive the container, pod, and even node, you need to use <strong>volumes</strong>. Also, if a pod is composed of multiple containers, then the pod's volumes can be used by all of the containers.</p><h3 id=\"volumes\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/\">Volumes</a></h3><p>After you define the volume, at the pod level, you need to mount it in each container that needs access to it.</p><p>There are many types of volumes to account for different use cases (usually, depending on what you want to happen when the <em>pod</em> is destroyed). Some common types of volumes are:</p><ul><li>emptyDir: creates a directory that is initially empty. Easy way to share files between different containers in a pod.</li><li>hostPath: mounts a file or directory from the node's filesystem into the pod. After the pod is deleted, the files will remain in the host.</li><li>Volumes that live on AWS, GCP, or Azure clouds.</li></ul><p>For more information about these and other type of volumes, refer to the documentation.</p><p>To mount a volume in a container, your pod descriptor (let's call this file <code>with-mounted-volume.yaml</code>) should look something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: with-mounted-volume\nspec:\n  volumes: # Volumes are defined at the pod level\n  - name: my-volume # We'll use this name to mount the volume inside the pod\n    hostPath: # Here we define the type of volume we want\n      path: /var/my-k8s-volume\n  containers:\n  - args:\n    - /bin/sh\n    - -c\n    - \"sleep 3600\"\n    image: busybox\n    name: bb\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: my-volume\n      mountPath: /tmp/my-volume-path\n  restartPolicy: Never\n</code></pre><p>Since we have created a <code>hostPath</code> volume, its content will outlive the pod. Let's test this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create a pod\nkubectl apply -f with-mounted-volume.yaml\n# Create a file at the mounted location\nkubectl exec -it with-mounted-volume -- sh -c \"echo 'Inside the pod' &gt; /tmp/my-volume-path/newfile\"\n# Try to read the file\nkubectl exec -it with-mounted-volume -- cat /tmp/my-volume-path/newfile\n# Delete the pod\nkubectl delete pods with-mounted-volume\n# Create a new pod\nkubectl apply -f with-mounted-volume.yaml\n# Explore the content of `/tmp/my-volume-path`  to see if it persisted\nkubectl exec -it with-mounted-volume -- cat /tmp/my-volume-path/newfile\n</code></pre><h4 id=\"revisiting-multi-container-pods\">Revisiting multi-container pods</h4><p>Now that we're familiar with volumes, let's create a multi-container pod that will use a mounted volume to share date between the containers.</p><ul><li>Our pod descriptor will be called <code>communicating-containers.yaml</code></li><li>We'll have a pod with 2 <code>busybox</code> containers.</li><li>One of them will append <code>Hello World</code> to a file every second.</li><li>The other container has access to the content of this file (and anything that is placed in this shared volume). We'll tail the shared file and see how the other container appends <code>Hello World</code> to it.</li></ul><p>This is the definition of our pod:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: communicating-containers\nspec:\n  volumes:\n  - name: vol\n    emptyDir: {}\n  containers:\n  - args:\n    - sh\n    - -c\n    - \"while true;do echo 'Hello World' &gt;&gt; /etc/shared/log; sleep 1; done\"\n    image: busybox\n    name: container-1\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: vol\n      mountPath: /etc/shared/ # The container can access the volume here\n  - args:\n    - sh\n    - -c\n    - \"sleep 3600\"\n    image: busybox\n    name: container-2\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: vol\n      mountPath: /etc/a-different-location # The volume can be mounted at different locations on each containers\n  restartPolicy: Never\n</code></pre><p>Let's create the pod:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl apply -f communicating-containers.yaml\n</code></pre><p>Once the pod is running, we can tail the file from <code>container-2</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl exec -it communicating-containers -c container-2 -- tail -f /etc/a-different-location/log\n</code></pre><p>Even though it is <code>container-1</code> that writes to <code>log</code>, since it is in a shared volume, <code>container-2</code> can see this file too.</p><h3 id=\"persistent-volumes\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/\">Persistent Volumes</a></h3><p>Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) decouple pods from storage technology. PVs are created by cluster administrators or dynamically based on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/\">Storage Classes</a>. </p><p>As opposed to the volumes we created earlier, defined at the pod level, PVs that have their own life cycle, independent from any pod.</p><p>After creating PVs, <em>users</em> can create Persistent Volume Claims to get the storage they need, <em>without needing to care about the actual infrastructure that is backing their storage</em>.</p><h4 id=\"example-1\">Example</h4><p>First, we define a Persistent Volume in pv.yaml:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolume\nmetadata:\n  name: myvolume\nspec:\n  capacity:\n    storage: 10Gi\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n    - ReadWriteMany\n  storageClassName: normal\n  hostPath:\n    path: /etc/foo\n</code></pre><p>For the Persistent Volume Claim, this is the descriptor (in pvc.yaml):</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: mypvc\nspec:\n  storageClassName: normal\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 4Gi\n</code></pre><p>Now, let's create the resources in our cluster</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># First, the Persistent Volume\nkubectl apply -f pv.yaml\n# Then, the Persistent Volume Claim\nkubectl apply -f pvc.yaml\n</code></pre><p>We can take the pod definition from the previous example and with a little tweak start using this Persistent Volume instead of the hostPath we had defined. This is the only thing we need to change:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">volumes:\n  - name: mypd # To refer to this volume when we configure the pod\n    persistentVolumeClaim: # Instead of hostPath\n      claimName: mypvc # The name of the pvc we just created\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"network-and-security-in-kubernetes\">Network and Security in Kubernetes</h2><p>Regarding security, these concepts are the bare minimum that you should be familiar with to be able to clear the CKAD exam.</p><h3 id=\"network-policies\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/\">Network Policies</a></h3><p>By default, all ingress traffic (that is, traffic flowing into your application) and egress traffic (that is, traffic flowing from your application) is allowed. Any pod can connect to any other pod, even if they're in different namespaces.</p><p>You can define network policies to control ingress and egress traffic based on different criteria.</p><p>To illustrate this, let's create a Network policy that allows traffic to our database only from pods with the label <code>access: allowed</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">kind: NetworkPolicy\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: access-db-policy # pick a name\nspec:\n  podSelector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: db # selector for the databse pods\n  ingress: # allow ingress traffic\n  - from:\n    - podSelector: \n        matchLabels: \n          access: allowed # Only the pods with this label will be able to send traffic to the database\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"security-context\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/\">Security Context</a></h3><p>When configuring a Security Context, you can enable security features like preventing the container from running as root, choosing as what user the pod is running, and so on. Here's an example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">spec:\n  securityContext:\n    runAsUser: 1000 #This sets the user for every container in this pod, but can be overriden\n  containers:\n  - name: my-container\n     image: alpine\n     securityContext:\n     \trunAsUser: 1001 # This overrides the user set at the pod level     \t\n  - name: another-container\n\t....\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"services-accounts\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/\">Services Accounts</a></h3><p>Your applications can connect to the API server and interact with it. For example, to retrieve information about the pods in a namespace. Service accounts allow applications to <em>authenticate</em> against the API server so that they can operate on it.</p><p>There is a <em>default service account</em>, but it is not a good practice to have all pods use it since not every application needs to be able to perform the same operations on the API server.</p><p>The simplest way to create a service account is via the command line:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl create serviceaccount my-sa\n</code></pre><p>Once created, you can assign it to a pod using the <code>serviceAccountName</code> field in the pod descriptor:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">spec:\n  serviceAccountName: my-sa\n  containers:\n  - name: web-server\n  ...\n</code></pre><p>Once the application has been authenticated, the next step is to see if it has the appropriate permissions for the action it is trying to accomplish, that is, to see if the application is <em>authorized</em>.</p><h3 id=\"role-based-access-control\"><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/\">Role Based Access Control</a></h3><p>A common method to manage authorization is <strong>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>. Service accounts are linked to one or more roles. Each role has permissions to perform a specific action on a certain resource.</p><p>RBAC authorization is defined in two separate steps:</p><ul><li>Role creation, using Role and ClusterRole resources, to specify the actions can be performed on certain resources</li><li>The binding of the roles to the accounts, using RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding resources.</li></ul><p>As you can imagine, the resources that contain the prefix Cluster are available cluster-wide, whereas the others are only defined in a particular namespace.</p><p>Since this is out of the scope of the CKAD exam, we will not get into the details of how to create and configure RBAC in your cluster.</p><h2 id=\"observability-and-debugging-in-kubernetes\">Observability and Debugging in Kubernetes</h2><p>Once you have deployed your applications, how do you know what's going on in your cluster?</p><p>We've already introduced Probes as a mechanism to decide if pods need to be restarted and if pods are ready to serve traffic. Here we will see more mechanisms to get a better understanding of the state of our cluster and troubleshoot any issues.</p><h4 id=\"getting-basic-pod-information\">Getting Basic Pod information</h4><p>To access the current state of the pods, there are two basic options. This is the first one:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubect get pods\n</code></pre><p>This will show you the pods' <code>STATUS</code>, <code>AGE</code>, number of <code>RESTARTS</code> and how many containers inside the pods are <code>READY</code>. &nbsp;You can pass flags to this command so that it displays the pods' IP address, labels, and more.</p><p>The second option provides more detailed information:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl describe pods my-pod\n</code></pre><p>At the very bottom of the output of this command, you'll find a list of events that will give you hints in case something goes wrong:</p><ul><li>Liveness/readiness probes are failing</li><li>There was an error pulling an image</li><li>Insufficient memory to schedule a pod</li></ul><p>And so on.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-get-a-container-s-logs\">How to Get a Container's Logs</h3><p>If a pod is running, you can access its logs using the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl logs pod-name [-c container-name] [-n namespace]\n</code></pre><p>You only need to pass the container name if there's more than one container in your pod. Similarly, the namespace flag is only needed to retrieve logs from pods in a different namespace.</p><p>You can even tail the logs with the <code>-f</code> flag:</p><pre><code>kubectl logs -f pod-name [-c container-name] [-n namespace]\n</code></pre><p>This will be enough for the certification. However, manually checking logs is cumbersome and inefficient in a real production environment. You will want to user other technologies to manage your logs or services like StackDriver if you're on GCP. If you want to learn more about StackDriver and GCP in general, be sure to check out my <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/google-cloud-platform-from-zero-to-hero/\">GCP guide</a>.</p><h3 id=\"troubleshooting-tips\">Troubleshooting Tips</h3><p>While there are no one-size-fit-all solutions when it comes to troubleshooting, it is usually a good idea to start at the pod level to get an idea of what might be the root cause of the issue.</p><p>You basic tools should be the commands we've covered above. In addition to this, you can always open a terminal inside the pod:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Assuming you container image uses sh\nkubectl exec -it my-pod -c container -n namespace -- sh\n</code></pre><p>It is <strong>not recommended</strong> to solve problems inside the pod this way, since by design pods are ephemeral and after they are restarted, your changes will be lost and the problem will manifest itself again. However, it's a good idea to gain good insight into the problem.</p><p>To retrieve your pod or node metrics, you can run the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl top pod pod-name\n</code></pre><p>These tools should help you solve the most common problems in your daily operations. There are too many things that can go wrong to cover here. If you face something you can't fix, I recommend that you visit this entry to get help <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application/\">debugging your applications.</a></p><h2 id=\"tips-and-tricks\">Tips and Tricks</h2><p>These are some \"tricks\" and I have found useful in my daily work with Kubernetes and especially to pass the CKAD exam. <strong>The exam is about speed and efficiency</strong>. With this in mind, let's see what we can do to perform better.</p><h3 id=\"set-aliases\">Set Aliases</h3><p>You will be typing the same commands over and over. As soon as you start the exam, create the following aliases:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Essential aliases. I strongly recommend setting them\nalias k='kubectl'\nalias kg='k get'\nalias kgpo='k get pods'\nalias kdpo='k describe pod'\nalias kd='k describe'\n\n# I also found this one very useful\nalias kap='k apply -f'\n\n# I have this for work only\nalias kgpoa='kgpo --all-namespaces'\nalias kgpol='kgpo --show-labels'\nalias kgpow='kgpo -o wide'\nalias kgd='kg deploy'\nalias kgs='kg svc'\nalias kdd='kd deploy'\nalias kds='kd svc'\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"search-your-command-history-faster\">Search Your Command History Faster</h3><p>I've seen a lot of engineers, many of them seniors, clumsily hitting the arrow up key 20 times to find something in their command history.</p><p>Instead, make sure you're comfortable using <code>Ctrl + r</code>. Just press it and start typing some part of the command you are looking for. Then, keep pressing <code>Ctrl + r</code> until you find it. Now you can press <code>Enter</code> to run it or simply start typing to modify it.</p><p>It is a huge time saver that not everyone is aware of.</p><h3 id=\"familiarize-yourself-with-the-documentation\">Familiarize Yourself With the Documentation</h3><p>You can consult the documentation during the exam. However, it's not the time to learn new things. Visit the documentation to get templates for yaml, to check specific parameters, and so on.</p><p>Make sure you have a good idea of the <strong>structure of the documentation</strong> and where to find things. Use the <strong>search functionality</strong> to go even faster.</p><p>Finally, this <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/\">Kubectl cheat sheet</a> is gold and <strong>will be available for you during the exam</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"you-don-t-need-to-memorize-everything\">You Don't Need to Memorize Everything</h3><p>In addition to the documentation, <code>kubectl</code> has a <code>--help</code> flag for most commands (<code>-h</code> is the short version). Most of the time you will find the answer to your question there.</p><p>In fact, I recommend that you do this before going to the documentation, since it is much faster.</p><p>Imagine that you want to create a resource quota object. You don't remember the yaml you need to write or the command to create it. However, you know the <code>kubectl command</code> and the <code>--help</code> flag. Then, you should try this before going to the docs:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># From this, we can get what we need to create our resource quota object\nkubeclt create quota -h\n# For example\nkubeclt create quota my-quota --hard=\"secrets=2\"\n</code></pre><p>You have plenty of sources of information and therefore you don't need to memorize many commands or any descriptors.</p><p>However, given that time is very limited during the exam, I think it's worth knowing some of the following commands by heart and how to leverage them.</p><h3 id=\"generate-a-basic-pod-specification-quickly\">Generate a basic pod specification quickly</h3><p><strong>This is extremely important</strong>. Instead of copying and pasting from the documentation every time you need a pod, use the following command to get a descriptor that you can modify later to meet your requirements:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Run pod nginx and write its spec into a file called pod.yaml\nkubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; pod.yaml\n# Some of these flags can be useful, depending on the problem\nkubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never  --port=80 --labels=key=val --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; pod.yaml\n</code></pre><p>Other useful parameters:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">--rm # to remove the pod as soon as it's finished\n-it # Enter the interactive terminal, to run commands directly inside the pod\n</code></pre><p>For example, you can use this to create a temporary pod and use it to verify your work:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl run tmp --image=busybox --restart=Never --rm -it -- /bin/sh\n</code></pre><p>Now you could &nbsp;<code>wget -O- svc:port</code> to see if your service is running, if network policies are working, and so on.</p><h5 id=\"note-\">Note:</h5><p>The <code>--dry-run=client -o yaml</code> is not just for pods, but for many resources. If we come back to the previous section where we created a resource quota, we could get a descriptor like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubeclt create quota my-quota --hard=\"secrets=2\" --dry-run=client -o yaml\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"use-grep\">Use grep</h3><p>You don't need to know regular expressions in depth. Just pass keywords. For instance, to retrieve information fast from the lengthy <code>kubectl describe pods my-pod</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># -i makes the search case-insensitive. It's a bit slower but for very short texts it won't make a difference\n# -C 2 will display the matched line as well as the 2 lines before and after the match (the \"context\")\nkubectl describe pods my-pod | grep -i -C 2 labels\nkubectl describe pods my-pod | grep -i -C 2 ip\n...\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"watch-pods-as-their-status-changes\">Watch Pods as Their Status Changes</h3><p>Instead of manually running <code>kubeclt get pods</code> every few seconds to see changes, pass the <code>watch</code> flag to see how your pods are doing:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl get pods --watch\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"delete-pods-fast\">Delete Pods Fast</h3><p>Making mistakes is part of the learning process. You'll make them also during the exam. Since the clock is ticking, we need to make sure we don't have to wait long when deleting resources. Add these flags to delete pods immediately:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">k delete pods my-pod --force --grace-period=0\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"run-a-pod-with-a-particular-command\">Run a Pod With a Particular Command</h3><p>I found it useful to learn how to pass commands to pods, jobs, cronjobs, and so on from the command line, like this example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl run loop --image=busybox -o yaml --dry-run=client --restart=Never \\\n-- /bin/sh -c 'for i in {1..10}; do echo \"Counting: $i\"; done' \\\n&gt; pod.yaml\n</code></pre><p>This would generate the file pod.yaml:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: null\n  labels:\n    run: loop\n  name: loop\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - args:\n    - /bin/sh\n    - -c\n    - 'for i in {1..10}; do echo \"Counting: $i\"; done'\n    image: busybox\n    name: loop\n    resources: {}\n  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst\n  restartPolicy: Never\nstatus: {}\n</code></pre><p>You can run a single command or chain multiple commands, like a mini bash script:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Run a particular executable\nkubectl run busybox --image=busybox -it --restart=Never -- echo 'hello world'\n# Run commands inside a shell (useful to run multiple commands)\nkubectl run busybox --image=busybox -it --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c 'echo hello world'\n</code></pre><p>It is not a huge difference but you don't need to remember how to write it in the pod descriptor or to waste time opening the documentation. <strong>You just need to use what you already know.</strong></p><h3 id=\"roll-out\">Roll out</h3><p>Familiarize yourself with the <code>rollout</code> command to get information about the status of your deployments.</p><p>I always start with the <code>--help</code> flag to remember how to do what I wanted to do.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">kubectl rollout -h\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h3><p>These final tips are not for the certification, but for daily work:</p><ul><li>This <a href=\"https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1\">kube-ps1 module</a> makes it easy to always know in which cluster and namespace you're operating, to prevent mistakes like messing with prod resources when you're not supposed to.</li><li>Also, I recommend having a look at <a href=\"https://helm.sh/\">Helm</a>. Helm is a package manager that can be used to deploy applications easily (think of it as <code>npm</code>). Helm also allows you to write templates that you can reuse to create objects based on different values (name, resource requests and limits, and so on).</li></ul><h2 id=\"practice-time\">Practice Time</h2><p><strong>You will always learn more by doing than by reading.</strong> So I have left some problems here that I solved during my preparation for you to practice. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises\">this repo</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552\">this article</a>.</p><p>I recommend solving all of them on your own before you check the proposed solution. Also, verify your work: check logs, create a pod to connect to your services, and so on.

a mobile gaming analytics platform that collects, stores, and analyzes large amounts of bulk and real-time data?</p><p>Well, after reading this article, you will.</p><p>I aim to take you <strong>from zero to hero in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in just one article</strong>. I will show you how to:</p><ul><li>Get started with a GCP account for free</li><li>Reduce costs in your GCP infrastructure</li><li>Organize your resources</li><li>Automate the creation and configuration of your resources</li><li>Manage operations: logging, monitoring, tracing, and so on.</li><li>Store your data</li><li>Deploy your applications and services</li><li>Create networks in GCP and connect them with your on-premise networks</li><li>Work with Big Data, AI, and Machine Learning</li><li>Secure your resources</li></ul><p>Once I have explained all the topics in this list, I will share with you a solution to the system I described. </p><p>If you do not understand some parts of it, you can go back to the relevant sections. And if that is not enough, visit the links to the documentation that I have provided.</p><p><strong><strong>Are you up for a challenge?</strong></strong> I have selected a few questions from old GCP Professional Certification exams. They will test your understanding of the concepts explained in this article.</p><p>I recommend trying to solve both the design and the questions <em><em>on your own</em></em>, going back to the guide if necessary. Once you have an answer, compare it to the proposed solution.</p><p>Try to go beyond what you are reading and ask yourself what would happen if requirement X changed:</p><ul><li>Batch vs streaming data</li><li>Regional vs global solution</li><li>A small number of users vs huge volume of users</li><li>Latency is not a problem vs real-time applications</li></ul><p>And any other scenarios you can think of.</p><p>At the end of the day, you are not paid just for what you know but for your thought process and the decisions you make. That is why it is vitally important that you exercise this skill.</p><p>At the end of the article, I'll provide more resources and next steps if you want to continue learning about GCP.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-get-started-with-google-cloud-platform-for-free\"><strong><strong><strong>How to get started with G</strong></strong>oogle <strong><strong>C</strong></strong>loud <strong><strong>P</strong></strong>latform<strong><strong> for </strong></strong>free</strong></h2><p>GCP currently offers a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free\">3 month free trial</a> with $300 US dollars of free credit. You can use it to get started, play around with GCP, and run experiments to decide if it is the right option for you. </p><p><strong><strong>You will NOT</strong></strong> <strong><strong>be charged</strong></strong> <strong><strong>at the end of your trial</strong></strong>. You will be notified and your services will stop running unless you decide to upgrade your plan.</p><p>I strongly recommend using this trial to practice. To learn, you have to <strong><strong>try things on your own</strong></strong>, face problems, break things, and fix them. It doesn't matter how good this guide is (or the official documentation for that matter) if you do not try things out.</p><h2 id=\"why-would-you-migrate-your-services-to-google-cloud-platform\"><strong>Why would you migrate your services to Google Cloud Platform?</strong></h2><p>Consuming resources from GCP, like storage or computing power, provides the following benefits:</p><ul><li>No need to spend a lot of money upfront for hardware</li><li>No need to upgrade your hardware and migrate your data and services every few years</li><li>Ability to scale to adjust to the demand, paying only for the resources you consume</li><li>Create proof of concepts quickly since provisioning resources can be done very fast</li><li>Secure and manage your <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs\">APIs</a></li><li>Not just infrastructure: data analytics and machine learning services are available in GCP</li></ul><p>GCP makes it easy to experiment and use the resources you need in an economical way.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-optimize-your-vms-to-reduce-costs-in-gcp\">How to optimize your VMs to reduce costs in GCP</h2><p>In general, you will only be <strong><strong>charged for the time your instances are running</strong></strong>. Google will not charge you for stopped instances. However, if they consume resources, like disks or reserved IPs, you might incur charges.</p><p>Here are some ways you can optimize the cost of running your applications in GCP.</p><h3 id=\"custom-machine-types\">Custom Machine Types</h3><p>GCP provides different <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types\">machine families</a> with predefined amounts of RAM and CPUs:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>General-purpose</strong></strong>. Offers the best price-performance ratio for a variety of workloads.</li><li><strong><strong>Memory-optimized</strong></strong>. Ideal for memory-intensive workloads. They offer more memory per core than other machine types.</li><li><strong><strong>Compute-optimized</strong></strong>. They offer the highest performance per core and and are optimized for compute-intensive workloads</li><li><strong><strong>Shared-core</strong></strong>. These machine types timeshare a physical core. This can be a cost-effective method for running small applications.</li></ul><p>Besides, you can create your custom machine with the amount of RAM and CPUs you need.</p><h3 id=\"preemptible-vm-s\">Preemptible VM's</h3><p>You can use preemptible virtual machines to save up to 80% of your costs. They are ideal <strong><strong>for fault-tolerant, non-critical applications</strong></strong>. &nbsp;You can save the progress of your job in a persistent disk using a shut-down script to continue where you left off.</p><p>Google may stop your instances at any time (with a 30-second warning) and will always stop them after 24 hours.</p><p>To reduce the chances of getting your VMs shut down, Google recommends:</p><ul><li>Using <strong><strong>many small instances</strong></strong> and</li><li>Running your jobs during<strong><strong> off-peak</strong> times</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Note</strong></strong>: Start-up and shut-down scripts apply to non-preemptible VMS as well. You can use them the control the behavior of your machine when it starts or stops. For instance, to install software, download data, or backup logs.</p><p>There are two options to define these scripts:</p><ul><li>When you are creating your instance in the Google Console, there is a field to paste your code.</li><li>Using the metadata server URL to point your instance to a script stored in Google Cloud Storage.</li></ul><p>This latter is preferred because it is easier to create many instances and to manage the script.</p><h3 id=\"sustained-use-discounts\">Sustained Use Discounts</h3><p>The longer you use your virtual machines (and Cloud SQL instances), the higher the discount - up to 30%. Google does this automatically for you.</p><h3 id=\"committed-use-discounts\">Committed Use Discounts</h3><p>You can get up to 57% discount if you commit to a certain amount of CPU and RAM resources for a period of 1 to 3 years.</p><p>To estimate your costs, use the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator\">Price Calculator</a>. This helps prevent any surprises with your bills and create <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets\">budget alerts</a>.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-manage-resources-in-gcp\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs\">How to manage resources in GCP</a></strong></h2><p>In this section, I will explain how you can manage and administer your Google Cloud resources.</p><h3 id=\"resource-hierarchy\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy\">Resource Hierarchy</a></strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/resource-manager.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"resource-manager\" width=\"800\" height=\"730\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>There are four types of resources that can be managed through Resource Manager:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>The organization resource</strong></strong>. It is the root node in the resource hierarchy. It represents an organization, for example, a company.</li><li><strong><strong>The projects resource</strong></strong>. For example, to separate projects for production and development environments. They are <strong><strong>required</strong></strong> to create resources.</li><li><strong><strong>The folder resource</strong></strong>. They provide an extra level of project isolation. For example, creating a folder for each department in a company.</li><li><strong><strong>Resources</strong></strong>. Virtual machines, database instances, load balancers, and so on.</li></ul><p>There are <strong><strong>quotas</strong></strong> that limit the maximum number of resources you can create to prevent unexpected spikes in billing. However, most quotas can be increased by opening a support ticket.</p><p>Resources in GCP follow a <strong><strong>hierarchy</strong></strong> via a parent/child relationship, similar to a traditional file system, where:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Permissions are inherited as we descend the hierarchy</strong></strong>. For example, permissions granted and the organization level will be propagated to all the folders and projects.</li><li>More permissive parent policies always overrule more restrictive child policies.</li></ul><p>This hierarchical organization helps you manage common aspects of your resources, such as access control and configuration settings.</p><p>You can create super admin accounts that have access to every resource in your organization. Since they are very powerful, make sure you follow <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/super-admin-best-practices\">Google's best practices</a>.</p><h3 id=\"labels\">Labels</h3><p>Labels are key-value pairs you can use to organize your resources in GCP. Once you attach a label to a resource (for instance, to a virtual machine), you can filter based on that label. This is useful also to break down your bills by labels.</p><p>Some common use cases:</p><ul><li>Environments: prod, test, and so on.</li><li>Team or product owners</li><li>Components: backend, frontend, and so on.</li><li>Resource state: active, archive, and so on.</li></ul><h3 id=\"labels-vs-network-tags\">Labels vs Network tags</h3><p>These two similar concepts seem to generate some confusion. I have summarized the differences in this table:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Labels</th>\n<th>Network tags</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Applied to any GCP resource</td>\n<td>Applied only for VPC resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Just organize resources</td>\n<td>Affect how resources work (ex: through application of firewall rules)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id=\"cloud-iam\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs\">Cloud IAM</a></strong></h3><p>Simply put, Cloud IAM controls <strong><strong>who can do what on which resource</strong></strong>. A resource can be a virtual machine, a database instance, a user, and so on. </p><p>It is important to notice that permissions are not directly assigned to users. Instead, they are bundled into <em><em>roles</em></em>, which are assigned to <em><em>members</em></em>. A <em><em>policy</em></em> is a collection of one or more bindings of a set of members to a role.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/IAM.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"IAM\" width=\"1472\" height=\"880\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"identities\">Identities</h3><p>In a GCP project, identities are represented by Google accounts, created outside of GCP, and defined by an email address (not necessarily @gmail.com). There are different types:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Google accounts*</strong></strong>. To represent people: engineers, administrators, and so on.</li><li><strong><strong>Service accounts</strong></strong>. Used to identify non-human users: applications, services, virtual machines, and others. The authentication process is defined by <em><em>account keys</em></em>, which can be managed by Google or by users (only for user-created service accounts).</li><li><strong><strong>Google Groups</strong></strong> are a collection of Google and service accounts.</li><li><strong><strong>G Suite Domain*</strong></strong> is the type of account you can use to identify organizations. If your organization is already using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory\">Active Directory</a>, it can be synchronized with Cloud IAM using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs\">Cloud Identity</a>.</li><li><strong><strong>allAuthenticatedUsers</strong></strong>. To represent any authenticated user in GCP.</li><li><strong><strong>allUsers</strong></strong>. To represent anyone, authenticated or not.</li></ul><p>Regarding service accounts, some of Google's best practices include:</p><ul><li>Not using the default service account</li><li>Applying the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege\">Principle of Least Privilege</a>. For instance:<br>1. Restrict who can act as a service account<br>2. Grant only the minimum set of permissions that the account needs<br>3. Create service accounts for each service, only with the permissions the account needs</li></ul><h3 id=\"roles\">Roles</h3><p>A role is a <strong><strong>collection of permissions</strong></strong>. There are three types of roles:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Primitive</strong></strong>. Original GCP roles that apply to the entire project. There are three concentric roles: <strong><strong>Viewer</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Editor</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>Owner</strong></strong>. Editor contains Viewer and Owner contains Editor.</li><li><strong><strong>Predefined</strong></strong>. Provides access to specific services, for example, storage.admin.</li><li><strong><strong>Custom</strong></strong>. lets you create your own roles, combining the specific permissions you need.</li></ul><p>When assigning roles, follow the principle of least privilege, too. In general, <strong><strong>prefer predefined over primitive roles</strong></strong>.</p><h3 id=\"cloud-deployment-manager\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs\">Cloud Deployment Manager</a></strong></h3><p>Cloud Deployment Manager automates repeatable tasks like provisioning, configuration, and deployments for any number of machines. </p><p>It is Google's <em><em>Infrastructure as Code</em></em> service, similar to Terraform - although you can deploy only GCP resources. It is used by <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/marketplace\">GCP Marketplace</a> to create pre-configured deployments.</p><p>You define your configuration in YAML files, listing the resources (created through API calls) you want to create and their properties. Resources are defined by their <strong><strong>name</strong></strong> (VM-1, disk-1), <strong><strong>type</strong></strong> (compute.v1.disk, compute.v1.instance) and <strong><strong>properties</strong></strong> (zone:europe-west4, boot:false).</p><p>To increase performance, resources are deployed in parallel. Therefore you need to <strong><strong>specify any dependencies using references</strong>.</strong> For instance, do not create virtual machine VM-1 until the persistent disk disk-1 has been created. In contrast, Terraform would figure out the dependencies on its own.</p><p>You can modularize your configuration files using templates so that they can be independently updated and shared. Templates can be defined in Python or Jinja2. The contents of your templates will be inlined in the configuration file that references them.</p><p>Deployment Manager will create a manifest containing your original configuration, any templates you have imported, and the expanded list of all the resources you want to create.</p><h2 id=\"cloud-operations-formerly-stackdriver-\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs\">Cloud Operations (formerly Stackdriver)</a></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/stackd.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"stackd\" width=\"246\" height=\"138\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Operations provide a set of tools for monitoring, logging, debugging, error reporting, profiling, and tracing of resources in GCP (AWS and even on-premise).</p><h3 id=\"cloud-logging\"><strong>Cloud Logging</strong></h3><p>Cloud Logging is GCP's centralized solution for real-time log management. For each of your projects, it allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data:</p><ul><li>By default, data will be stored for a certain period of time. The retention period varies depending on the type of log. You cannot retrieve logs after they have passed this retention period.</li><li>Logs can be exported for different purposes. To do this, you create a <strong><strong>sink</strong></strong>, which is composed of a <strong><strong>filter</strong></strong> (to select what you want to log) and a <strong><strong>destination</strong></strong>: Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for long term retention, BigQuery for analytics, or Pub/Sub to stream it into other applications.</li><li>You can create log-based metrics in Cloud Monitoring and even get alerted when something goes wrong.</li></ul><p>Logs are a named collection of <strong><strong>log entries</strong></strong>. Log entries record status or events and includes the name of its log, for example, compute.googleapis.com/activity. There are two main types of logs:</p><p><strong>First, User Logs:</strong></p><ul><li>These are generated by your applications and services. </li><li>They are written to Cloud Logging using the Cloud Logging API, client libraries, or <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/agent\">logging agents</a> installed on your virtual machines. </li><li>They stream logs from common third-party applications like MySQL, MongoDB, or Tomcat.</li></ul><p><strong>Second, Security logs, divided into:</strong></p><ul><li>Audit logs, for administrative changes, system events, and data access to your resources. For example, who created a particular database instance or to log a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/live-migration\">live migration</a>. Data access logs must be explicitly enabled and may incur additional charges. The rest are enabled by default, cannot be disabled, and are free of charges.</li><li>Access Transparency logs, for actions taken by Google staff when they access your resources for example to investigate an issue you reported to the support team.</li></ul><h4 id=\"vpc-flow-logs\">VPC Flow Logs</h4><p>They are specific to VPC networks (which I will introduce later). VPC flow logs record a <strong><strong>sample of network flows</strong></strong> sent from and received by VM instances, which can be later access in Cloud Logging. </p><p>They can be used to monitor network performance, usage, forensics, real-time security analysis, and expense optimization.</p><p><strong><strong>Note</strong></strong>: you may want to log your billing data for analysis. In this case, you do <em><em>not</em></em> create a sink. You can directly export your reports to BigQuery.</p><h3 id=\"cloud-monitoring\"><strong>Cloud Monitoring</strong></h3><p>Cloud Monitoring lets you monitor the performance of your applications and infrastructure, visualize it in dashboards, create <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks\">uptime checks</a> to detect resources that are down and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts\">alert</a> you based on these checks so that you can fix problems in your environment. You can monitor resources in GCP, AWS, and even on-premise.</p><p>It is recommended to create a separate project for Cloud Monitoring since it can keep track of resources across multiple projects. </p><p>Also, it is recommended to install a monitoring agent in your virtual machines to send application metrics (including many third-party applications) to Cloud Monitoring. Otherwise, Cloud Monitoring will only display CPU, disk traffic, network traffic, and uptime metrics.</p><h4 id=\"alerts\">Alerts</h4><p>To receive alerts, you must declare an <strong><strong>alerting policy</strong></strong>. An alerting policy defines the <strong><strong>conditions</strong></strong> under which a service is considered unhealthy. When the conditions are met, a new incident will be created and notifications will be sent (via email, Slack, SMS, PagerDuty, etc). </p><p>A policy belongs to an individual workspace, which can contain a maximum of 500 policies.</p><h4 id=\"trace\">Trace</h4><p>Trace helps <strong><strong>find bottlenecks in your services</strong></strong>. You can use this service to figure out how long it takes to handle a request, which microservice takes the longest to respond, where to focus to reduce the overall latency, and so on.</p><p>It is enabled by default for applications running on Google App Engine (GAE) - Standard environment - but can be used for applications running on GCE, GKE, and Google App Engine Flexible.</p><h4 id=\"error-reporting\">Error Reporting</h4><p>Error Reporting will aggregate and display errors produced in services written in Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, or .NET. running on GCE, GKE, GAP, Cloud Functions, or Cloud Run.</p><h4 id=\"debug\">Debug</h4><p>Debug lets you inspect the application's state without stopping your service. Currently supported for Java, Go, Node.js and Python. It is automatically integrated with GAE but can be used on GCE, GKE, and Cloud Run.</p><h4 id=\"profile\">Profile</h4><p>Profiler that continuously gathers CPU usage and memory-allocation information from your applications. To use it, you need to install a profiling agent.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-store-data-in-gcp\"><strong>How to store data in GCP</strong></h2><p>In this section, I will cover both Google Cloud Storage (for any type of data, including files, images, video, and so on), the different database services available in GCP, and how to decide which storage option works best for you.</p><h3 id=\"google-cloud-storage-gcs-\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs\">Google Cloud Storage (GCS)</a></strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/gcs.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"gcs\" width=\"2000\" height=\"983\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>GCS is Google's <strong><strong>storage service for unstructured data</strong></strong>: pictures, videos, files, scripts, database backups, and so on. </p><p>Objects are placed in <strong><strong>buckets</strong></strong>, from which they inherit permissions and storage classes. </p><p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes\">Storage classes</a> provide different SLAs for storing your data to minimize costs for your use case. A bucket's storage class can be changed (under some restrictions), but it will affect new objects added to the bucket only.</p><p>In addition to Google's console, you can interact with GCS from your command line, using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil\">gsutil</a>. You can use specify:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Multithreaded updates</strong></strong> when you need to upload a large number of small files. The command looks like gsutil -m cp files gs://my-bucket)</li><li><strong><strong>Parallel updates</strong></strong> when you need to upload large files. For more details and restrictions, visit this <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cp#parallel-composite-uploads\">link</a>.</li></ul><p>Another option to upload files to GCS is <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs\">Storage Transfer Service (STS)</a>, a service that imports data to a GCS bucket from:</p><ul><li>An AWS S3 bucket</li><li>A resource that can be accessed through HTTP(S)</li><li>Another Google Cloud Storage bucket</li></ul><p>If you need to upload huge amounts of data (from hundreds of terabytes up to one petabyte) consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/transfer-appliance/docs/2.2\">Data Transfer Appliance</a>: ship your data to a Google facility. Once they have uploaded the data to GCS, the process of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/transfer-appliance/docs/2.0/data-rehydration\">data rehydration</a> reconstitutes the files so that they can be accessed again.</p><h4 id=\"object-lifecycle-management\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle\">Object lifecycle management</a></h4><p>You can define rules that determine what will happen to an object (will it be archived or deleted) when a certain condition is met. </p><p>For example, you could define a policy to automatically change the storage class of an object from Standard to Nearline after 30 days and to delete it after 180 days.</p><p>This is the way a rule can be defined:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">{\n   \"lifecycle\":{\n      \"rule\":[\n         {\n            \"action\":{\n               \"type\":\"Delete\"\n            },\n            \"condition\":{\n               \"age\":30,\n               \"isLive\":true\n            }\n         },\n         {\n            \"action\":{\n               \"type\":\"Delete\"\n            },\n            \"condition\":{\n               \"numNewerVersions\":2\n            }\n         },\n         {\n            \"action\":{\n               \"type\":\"Delete\"\n            },\n            \"condition\":{\n               \"age\":180,\n               \"isLive\":false\n            }\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n}</code></pre><p>It will be applied through gsutils or a REST API call. Rules can be created also through the Google Console.</p><h4 id=\"permissions-in-gcs\">Permissions in GCS</h4><p>In addition to IAM roles, you can use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage access to the resources in a bucket. </p><p>Use IAM roles when possible, but remember that <strong><strong>ACLs</strong></strong> grant access to buckets and <strong><strong>individual objects</strong></strong>, while <strong><strong>IAM roles are project or bucket wide</strong></strong> permissions. Both methods work in tandem.</p><p>To grant temporary access to users outside of GCP, use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls\">Signed URLs</a>.</p><h4 id=\"bucket-lock\">Bucket lock</h4><p>Bucket locks allow you to enforce a <strong><strong>minimum retention period</strong></strong> for objects in a bucket. You may need this for auditing or legal reasons.</p><p><strong><strong>Once a bucket is locked, it cannot be unlocked</strong></strong>. To remove, you need to first remove all objects in the bucket, which you can only do after they all have reached the retention period specified by the retention policy. Only then, you can delete the bucket. </p><p>You can include the retention policy when you are creating the bucket or add a retention policy to an existing bucket (it retroactively applies to existing objects in the bucket too).</p><p>Fun fact: the maximum retention period is 100 years.</p><h3 id=\"relational-managed-databases-in-gcp\"><strong>Relational Managed Databases in GCP</strong></h3><p>Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner are two managed database services available in GCP. If you do not want to deal with all the work necessary to maintain a database online, they are a great option. You can always spin a virtual machine and manage your own database.</p><h4 id=\"cloud-sql\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs\">Cloud SQL</a></h4><p>Cloud SQL provides access to a managed MySQL or PostgreSQL database instance in GCP. Each instance is limited to a <strong><strong>single region</strong></strong> and has a <strong><strong>maximum capacity of 30 TB</strong></strong>. </p><p>Google will take care of the installation, backups, scaling, monitoring, failover, and read replicas. For availability reasons, replicas must be defined in the same region but a different zone from the primary instances.</p><p>Data can be easily imported (first uploading the data to Google Cloud Storage and then to the instance) and exported using SQL dumps or CSV files format. Data can be compressed to reduce costs (you can directly import .gz files). For \"lift and shift\" migrations, this is a great option.</p><p>If you need global availability or more capacity, consider using Cloud Spanner.</p><h4 id=\"cloud-spanner\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs\">Cloud Spanner</a></h4><p>Cloud Spanner is globally available and can scale (horizontally) very well. </p><p>These two features make it capable of supporting different use cases than Cloud SQL and more expensive too. Cloud Spanner is not an option for lift and shift migrations.</p><h3 id=\"nosql-managed-databases-in-gcp\"><strong>NoSQL Managed Databases in GCP</strong></h3><p>Similarly, GCP provides two managed NoSQL databases, Bigtable and Datastore, as well as an in-memory database service, Memorystore.</p><h4 id=\"datastore\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs\">Datastore</a></h4><p>Datastore is a completely no-ops, highly-scalable document database ideal for web and mobile applications: game states, product catalogs, real-time inventory, and so on. It's great for:</p><ul><li>User profiles - mobile apps</li><li>Game save states</li></ul><p>By default, Datastore has a built-in <strong><strong>index</strong></strong> that improves performance on simple queries. You can create your own indices, called <strong><strong>composite indexes</strong></strong>, defined in YAML format.</p><p>If you need extreme throughput (huge number of reads/writes per second), use Bigtable instead.</p><h4 id=\"bigtable\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs\">Bigtable</a></h4><p>Bigtable is a NoSQL database ideal for analytical workloads where you can expect a very high volume of writes, reads in the milliseconds, and the ability to store terabytes to petabytes of information. It's great for:</p><ul><li>Financial analysis</li><li>IoT data</li><li>Marketing data</li></ul><p>Bigtable requires the creation and configuration of your nodes (as opposed to the fully-managed Datastore or BigQuery). You can add or remove nodes to your cluster with zero downtime. The simplest way to interact with Bigtable is the command-line tool <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/cbt-overview\">cbt</a>.</p><p>Bigtable's performance will depend on the design of your database schema.</p><ul><li>You can only define one key per row and must keep all the information associated with an entity in the same row. Think of it as a hash table.</li><li>Tables are sparse: if there is no information associated with a column, no space is required.</li><li>To make reads more efficient, try to store related entities in adjacent rows.</li></ul><p>Since this topic is worth an article on its own, I recommend you read the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/performance\">documentation</a>.</p><h4 id=\"memorystore\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs\">Memorystore</a></h4><p>It provides a managed version of Redis and Memcache (in-memory databases), resulting in very fast performance. Instances are regional, like Cloud SQL, and have a capacity of up to 300 GB.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-choose-your-database\"><strong>How to choose your database</strong></h3><p>Google loves decision trees. This one will help you choose the right database your your projects. For unstructured data consider GCS or process it using Dataflow (discussed later).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/choose-db.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"choose-db\" width=\"736\" height=\"700\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"how-does-networking-work-in-gcp\"><strong>How does networking work in GCP?</strong></h2><h3 id=\"virtual-private-cloud-vpc-see-the-docs-here\"><strong>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/\">see the docs here</a></strong></h3><p>You can use the same network infrastructure that Google uses to run its services: YouTube, Search, Maps, Gmail, Drive, and so on. </p><p>Google infrastructure is divided into:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Regions</strong></strong>: Independent geographical areas, at least 100 miles apart from each other, where Google hosts datacenters. It consists of 3 or more zones. For example, us-central1.</li><li><strong><strong>Zones</strong></strong>: Multiple individual datacenters within a region. For example, us-central1-a.</li><li><strong><strong>Edge Points of Presence</strong></strong>: points of connection between Google's network and the rest of the internet.</li></ul><p>GCP infrastructure is designed in a way that all traffic between regions travels through a global private network, resulting in better security and performance.</p><p>On top of this infrastructure, you can build networks for your resources, Virtual Private Clouds. They are <strong><strong>software-defined networks</strong></strong>, where all the traditional network concepts apply:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#subnets_vs_subnetworks\">Subnets</a>. Logical partitions of a network defined using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\">CIDR notation</a>. They belong to one region only but can span multiple zones. If you have multiple subnets (including your on-premise networks if they are connected to GCP), make sure the CIDR ranges do not overlap.</li><li><strong><strong>IP addresses</strong></strong>. Can be internal (for private communication within GCP) or external (to communicate with the rest of the internet). For external IP addresses, you can use an <strong><strong>ephemeral IP</strong></strong> or pay for a <strong><strong>static IP</strong></strong>. In general, you need an external IP address to connect to GCP services. However, in some cases, you can configure <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-access-options\">private access</a> for instances that only have an internal IP.</li><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls\">Firewalls rules</a>, to allow or deny traffic to your virtual machines, both incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress). By default, all ingress traffic is denied and all egress traffic is allowed. Firewall rules are defined at the VPC level but they <strong><strong>apply to individual instances or groups of instances</strong></strong> using <strong><strong>network tags</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>IP ranges</strong></strong>. <br><strong><strong>Common issue</strong></strong>: If you know your VMs are working correctly but you cannot access them through HTTP(s) or cannot SSH into them, have a look at your firewall rules.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/vpc.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"vpc\" width=\"700\" height=\"458\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>You can create <strong><strong>hybrid networks</strong></strong> connecting your on-premise infrastructure to your VPC.</p><p>When you create a project, a <strong><strong>default network</strong></strong> will be created with subnets in each region (auto mode). You can delete this network, but you need to create at least one network to be able to create virtual machines. </p><p>You can also create your <strong><strong>custom networks</strong></strong>, where no subnets are created by default and you have full control over subnet creation (custom mode).</p><p>The main goal of a VPC is the<strong><strong> separation of network resource</strong></strong>s. A GCP project is a way to organize resources and manage permissions. </p><p>Users of project A need permissions to access resources in project B. All users can access any VPC defined in any project to which they belong. Within the same VPC, resources in subnet 1 need to be granted access to resources in subnet 2.</p><p>In terms of IAM roles, there is a distinction between who can create network resources (Network admin, to create subnets, virtual machines, and so on) and who is responsible for the security of the resources (Security Admin, to create firewall rules, SSL certificates, and so on). </p><p>The Compute Instance Admin role combines both roles.</p><p>As usual, there are quotas and limits to what you can do in a VPC, amongst them:</p><ul><li>The maximum number of VPCs in a project.</li><li>The maximum number of virtual machines per VPC.</li><li>No broadcast or multicast.</li><li>VPCs cannot use IPv6 to communicate internally, although global load balancers support IPv6 traffic.</li></ul><h3 id=\"how-to-share-resources-between-multiple-vpcs\"><strong>How to share resources between multiple VPCs</strong></h3><h4 id=\"shared-vpc\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc\">Shared VPC</a></h4><p>Shared VPCs are a way to share resources between different projects within the same organization. This allows you to control billing and manage access to the resources in different projects, following the principle of least privilege. Otherwise you'd have to put all the resources in a single project.</p><p>To design a shared VPC, projects fall under three categories:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Host project</strong></strong>. It is the project that hosts the common resources. There can only be one host project.</li><li><strong><strong>Service project</strong></strong>: Projects that can access the resources in the host project. A project cannot be both host and service.</li><li><strong><strong>Standalone project</strong></strong>. Any project that does not make use of the shared VPC.</li></ul><p>You will only be able to communicate between resources created <strong><strong>after</strong></strong> you define your host and service projects.

Each tunnel has a maximum capacity of 3 Gb per second and you can use a maximum of 8 for better performance. These two characteristics make VPN the cheapest option.</p><p>You can define two types of routes between your VPC and your on-premise networks:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Static routes</strong></strong>. You have to manually define and update them, for example when you add a new subnet. This is not the preferred option.</li><li><strong><strong>Dynamic routes</strong></strong>. Routes are automatically handled (defined and updated) for you using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router\">Cloud Router</a>. This is the preferred option when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol\">BGP</a> is available.</li></ul><p>Your traffic gets encrypted and decrypted by VPN Gateways (in GCP, they are regional resources). </p><p>To have a more robust connection, consider using multiple VPN gateways and tunnels.

With Cloud Interconnect, there is a <strong><strong>direct physical connection</strong></strong> between your on-premises network and your VPC. This option will be more expensive but will provide the best performance.</p><p>There are two types of interconnect available, depending on how you want your connection to GCP to materialize:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Dedicated interconnect</strong></strong>. There is \"a direct cable\" connecting your infrastructure and GCP. This is the fastest option, with a capacity of 10 to 200 Gb per second. However, it is not available everywhere: at the time of this writing, only in 62 locations in the world.</li><li><strong><strong>Partner interconnect</strong></strong>. You connect through a service provider. This option is more geographically available, but the not as fast as a dedicated interconnects: from 50 Mb per second to 10 Gb per second.</li></ul><h3 id=\"cloud-peering\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-vpc-peering\">Cloud Peering</a></h3><p>Cloud peering is not a GCP service, but you can use it to connect your network to Google's network and access services like Youtube, Drive, or GCP services. </p><p>A common use case is when you need to connect to Google but don't want to do it over the public internet.</p><h3 id=\"other-networking-services\"><strong>Other networking services</strong></h3><h4 id=\"load-balancers-lb-\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/load\">Load Balancers (LB)</a></h4><p>In GCP, load balancers are pieces of software that distribute user requests among a group of instances. </p><p>A load balancer may have multiple backends associated with it, having rules to decide the appropriate backend for a given request.</p><p>There are different types of load balancers. They differ in the type of traffic (HTTP vs TCP/UDP - Layer 7 or Layer 4), whether they handle external or internal traffic, and whether their scope is regional or global:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>HTTP(s)</strong></strong>. Global LB that handles HTTP(s) requests, distributing traffic to multiple regions based on user location (to the closest region with available instances) or URL maps (the LB can be configured to forward requests to <em><em>URL/news</em></em> to a backend service and <em><em>URL/videos</em></em> to a different one). It can receive both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic (but this one is terminated at the LB level and proxied as IPv4 to the backends) and has native support for WebSockets.</li><li><strong><strong>SSL Proxy LB</strong></strong>. <strong><strong>Global</strong></strong> LB that handles encrypted TCP traffic, managing SSL certificates for you.</li><li><strong><strong>TCP Proxy LB</strong></strong>. <strong><strong>Global</strong></strong> LB that handles unencrypted TCP traffic. Like SSL Proxy LB, by default, it will not preserve the client's IP, but this can be changed.</li><li><strong><strong>Network Load Balancer</strong></strong>. Regional LB that handles TCP/UDP external traffic, based on IP address and port.</li><li><strong><strong>Internal Load Balancer</strong></strong>. Like a Network LB, but for internal traffic.</li></ul><p>For the visual learners:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/lb.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"lb\" width=\"1217\" height=\"882\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h4 id=\"cloud-dns\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs\">Cloud DNS</a></h4><p>Cloud DNS is Google's managed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\">Domain Name System (DNS)</a> host, both for internal and external (public) traffic. It will map URLs like <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\">https://www.freecodecamp.org/</a> to an IP address.

If you have data that does not change often (images, videos, CSS, etc.) it makes sense to cache it close to your users. Cloud CDN provides 90 Edges Point of Presence (POP) to cache the data close to your end-users.</p><p>After the first request, static data can be stored in a POP, usually much closer to your user than your main servers. Thus, in subsequent requests, you can retrieve the data faster from the POP and reduce the load on your backend servers.</p><h2 id=\"where-can-you-run-your-applications-in-gcp\"><strong>Where can you run your applications in GCP?</strong></h2><p>I will present 4 places where your code can run in GCP:</p><ul><li>Google Compute Engine</li><li>Google Kubernetes Engine</li><li>App Engine</li><li>Cloud Functions</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/gce.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"gce\" width=\"800\" height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><strong><strong>Note</strong></strong>: there is a 5th option: Firebase is Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop apps.</p><h3 id=\"compute-engine-gce-\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs\">Compute Engine (GCE)</a></strong></h3><p>Compute engine allows you to spin up virtual machines in GCP. This section will be longer since GCE provides the infrastructure where GKE and GAE run.</p><p>In the introduction, I talked about the different types of VMs you can create in GCE. Now, I will cover where to store the data, how to back it up, and how to create instances with all the data and configuration you need.</p><h4 id=\"where-to-store-your-vm-s-data-disks\">Where to store your VM's data: disks</h4><p>Your data can be stored in <strong><strong>Persistent disks</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Local SSDs</strong></strong>, or in <strong><strong>Cloud Storage</strong></strong>.</p><h5 id=\"persistent-disk\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/persistent-disk\">Persistent Disk</a></strong></h5><p>Persistent disks provide durable and reliable block storage. They are not local to the machine. Rather, they are networked attached, which has its pros and cons:</p><ul><li>Disks can be resized, attached, or detached from a VM even if the instance is in use.</li><li>They have high reliability.</li><li>Disks can survive the instance after its deletion.</li><li>If you need more space, simply attach more disks.</li><li>Larger disks will provide higher performance.</li><li>Being networked attached, they are less performant than local options. SSD persistent disks are also available for more demanding workloads.</li></ul><p>Every instance will need one boot disk and it must be of this type.</p><h5 id=\"local-ssd\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/local-ssd\">Local SSD</a></strong></h5><p>Local SSDs are attached to a VM to which they provide high-performance ephemeral storage. As of now, you can attach up to eight 375GB local SSDs to the same instance. However, this data will be lost if the VM is killed.</p><p>Local SSDs can only be attached to a machine when it is created, but you can attach both local SSDs and persistent disks to the same machine.</p><p>Both types of disks are zonal resources.</p><h5 id=\"cloud-storage\"><strong>Cloud Storage</strong></h5><p>We have extensively covered GCS in a previous section. GCS is not a filesystem, but you can use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse\">GCS-Fuse</a> to mount GCS buckets as filesystems in Linux or macOS systems. You can also let apps download and upload data to GCS using standard filesystem semantics.</p><h4 id=\"how-to-back-up-your-vm-s-data-snapshots\">How to back up your VM's data: Snapshots</h4><p>Snapshots are backups of your disks. To reduce space, they are created incrementally:</p><ul><li>Back up 1 contains all your disk content</li><li>Back up 2 only contains the data that has changed since back up 1</li><li>Back up 3 only contains the data that has changed since back up 2, and so on</li></ul><p>This is enough to restore the state of your disk.</p><p>Even though snapshots can be taken without stopping the instance, it is best practice to at least reduce its activity, stop writing data to disk, and flush buffers. This helps you make sure you get an accurate representation of the content of the disk.</p><h4 id=\"images\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images\">Images</a></h4><p>Images refer to the operating system images needed to create boot disks for your instances. There are two types of images:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Public images</strong></strong>. They are provided and maintained by Google, open-source communities, and third-party vendors. Ready for you to use as soon as you create your project. Available to anyone</li><li><strong><strong>Custom images</strong></strong>. Images that you have created.</li><li>They are linked to the project in which you created them but you can share them with other projects.</li><li>You can create images from <strong><strong>persistent disks</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>other images</strong></strong>, both from the same project or shared from another project.</li><li>Related images can be grouped in <strong><strong>image families</strong></strong> to simplify the management of the different image versions.</li><li>For Linux-based images, you can share them also by exporting them to Cloud Storage as a tar.gz file.</li></ul><p>You might be asking yourself what is the difference between an image and a snapshot. Mainly, <strong><strong>their purpose</strong></strong>. Snapshots are taken as incremental backups of a disk while images are created to spin up new virtual machines and configure instance templates.</p><p><strong>Note on images vs startup scripts:</strong></p><p>For simple setups, startup scripts are also an option. They can be used to test changes quickly, but the VMs will take longer to be ready compared to using an image where all the needed software is installed, configured, and so on.</p><h4 id=\"instance-groups\">Instance groups</h4><p>Instance groups let you treat a group of instances as a single unit and they come in two flavors:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Unmanaged instance group</strong></strong>. Formed by a heterogeneous group of instances that required individual configuration settings.</li><li><strong><strong>Managed instance group (MIG).</strong></strong> This is the preferred option when possible. All the machines look the same, making it easy to configure them, create them in multiple zones (high availability), replace them if they become unhealthy (auto-healing), balance the traffic among them, and create new instances if they traffic increases (horizontal scaling).</li></ul><p>To create a MIGs, you need to define an <strong><strong>instance template</strong></strong>, specifying your machine type, zone, OS image, startup and shutdown scripts, and so on. Instance templates are immutable.</p><p>To update a MIG, you need to create a new template and use the <strong><strong>Managed Instance Group Updated</strong></strong> to deploy the new version to every machine in the group. </p><p>This functionality can be used to create <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html\">canary tests</a>, deploying your changes to a small fraction of your machines first.</p><p>Visit this <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/distributing-instances-with-regional-instance-groups\">link</a> to know more about Google's recommendations to ensure an application deployed via a managed instance group can handle the load even if an entire zone fails.</p><h4 id=\"security-best-practices-for-gce\">Security best practices for GCE</h4><p>To increase the security of your infrastructure in GCE, have a look at:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm\">Shielded VMs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/connecting-securely\">Prevent instances from being reached from the public internet</a></li><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/restricting-image-access#:~:text=Use the Trusted image feature,images%2C disks%2C and snapshots.\">Trusted images</a> to make sure your users can only create disks from images in <strong><strong>specific projects</strong></strong></li></ul><h3 id=\"app-engine\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs\">App Engine</a></strong></h3><p>App Engine is a great choice when you want to focus on the code and let Google handle your infrastructure. You just need to choose the region where your app will be deployed (this cannot be changed once it is set). Amongst its main use cases are websites, mobile apps, and game backends.</p><p>You can easily update the version of your app that is running via the command line or the Google Console. </p><p>Also, if you need to deploy a risky update to your application, you can split the traffic between the old and the risky versions for a canary deployment. Once you are happy with the results, you can route all the traffic to the new version.</p><p>There are two App Engine environments:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Standard</strong></strong>. This version can quickly scale up or down (even to zero instances) to adjust to the demand. Currently, only a few programming languages are supported (Go, Java, PHP, and Python) and you do not have access to a VPC (including VPN connections). It can be scaled down to zero instances.</li><li><strong><strong>Flexible.</strong></strong> Your code runs in Docker containers in GCE, hence more flexible than the Standard environment. However, creating new instances is slower and it cannot be scaled down to zero instances. It is suited for more consistent traffic.</li></ul><p>Regardless of the environment, there are no up-front costs and you only pay for what you use (billed per second).</p><p><strong><strong>Memcache</strong></strong> is a built-in App Engine, giving you the possibility to choose between a <strong><strong>shared</strong></strong> cache (default, free option) or a <strong><strong>dedicated</strong></strong> cache for better performance. </p><p>Visit this link to know more about the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/memcache#best_practices\">best practices</a> you should follow to maximize the performance of your app.</p><h3 id=\"google-kubernetes-engine-gke-\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs\">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</a></strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> is an open-source <strong><strong>container orchestration system</strong></strong>, developed by Google. </p><p>Kubernetes is a very extensive topic in itself and I will not cover here. You just need to know that GKE makes it easy to run and manage your Kubernetes clusters on GCP. </p><p>Google also provides <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/container-registry\">Container Registry</a> to store your container images - think of it as your private Docker Hub.</p><p><strong><strong>Note</strong></strong>: You can use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs\">Cloud Build</a> to run your builds in GCP and, among other things, produce Docker images and store them in Container Registry. Cloud Build can import your code from Google Cloud Storage, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs\">Cloud Source Repository</a>, GitHub, or Bitbucket.</p><h3 id=\"cloud-functions\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs\">Cloud Functions</a></strong></h3><p>Cloud Functions are the equivalent of Lambda functions in AWS. Cloud functions are <strong><strong>serverless</strong></strong>. They let you focus on the code and not worry about the infrastructure where it is going to run.</p><p>With Cloud Functions it is <strong><strong>easy to respond to events</strong></strong> such as uploads to a GCS bucket or messages in a Pub/Sub topic. You are only charged for the time your function is running in response to an event.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-work-with-big-data-in-gcp\"><strong>How to work with Big Data in GCP</strong></h2><h3 id=\"bigquery\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/\">BigQuery</a></strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/bigq.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"bigq\" width=\"1360\" height=\"904\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>BigQuery is Google's serverless data warehousing and provides analytics capabilities for petabyte-scale databases. </p><p>BigQuery automatically backs up your tables, but you can always export them to GCS to be on the safe side - incurring extra costs. </p><p>Data can be ingested in batches (for instance, from a GCS bucket) or from a stream in multiple formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet, or Avro (most performant). Also, you can query data that resides in external sources, called federated sources, for example, GCS buckets.</p><p>You can interact with your data in BigQuery using SQL via the</p><ul><li>Google Console.</li><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool\">Command-line</a>, running commands like <code>bq query 'SELECT field FROM ....</code></li><li>REST API.</li><li>Code using client libraries.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions\">User-Defined Functions</a> allow you to combine SQL queries with JavaScript functions to create complex operations.</p><p>BigQuery is a columnar data store: records are stored in columns. Tables are collections of columns and datasets are collections of tables. </p><p>Jobs are actions to load, export, query, or copy data that BigQuery runs on your behalf. </p><p>Views are virtual tables defined by a SQL query and are useful sharing data with others when you want to control exactly what they have access to.</p><p>Two important concepts related to tables are:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Partitioned tables</strong></strong>. To limit the amount of data that needs to be queried, tables can be divided into partitions. This can be done based on ingest time or including a timestamp or date column or an integer range. This way it is easy to query for certain periods without querying the full table. To reduce costs, you can define an expiration period after which the partition will be deleted.</li><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables\"><strong><strong>Clustered tables</strong></strong></a>. Data are clustered by column (for instance, order_id). When you query your table, only the rows associated with this column will be read. BigQuery will perform this clustering automatically based on one or more columns.</li></ul><p>Using IAM roles, you can control access at a project, dataset, or view level, but <em><em>not at the table level</em></em>. Roles are complex for BigQuery, so I recommend checking the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#predefined_roles_comparison_matrix\">documentation</a>. </p><p>For instance, the jobUser role only lets you run jobs while the user role lets you run jobs and create datasets (but not tables).</p><p>Your costs depend on how much data you store and stream into BigQuery and how much data you query. To reduce costs, BigQuery automatically caches previous queries (per user). This behavior can be disabled.</p><p>When you don't edit data for 90 days, it automatically moves to a cheaper storage class. You pay for what you use, but it is possible to opt for a flat rate (only if you need more than the 2000 <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots\">slots</a> that are allocated by default). </p><p>Check these links to see how to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-performance-overview\">optimize your performance</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/cost-optimization-best-practices-for-bigquery\">costs</a>.</p><h3 id=\"cloud-pub-sub\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs\">Cloud Pub/Sub</a></strong></h3><p>Pub/Sub is Google's <strong><strong>fully-managed message queue</strong></strong>, allowing you to decouple publishers (adding messages to the queue) and subscribers (consuming messages from the queue).</p><p>Although it is similar to <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Kafka</a>, Pub/Sub is not a direct substitute. They can be combined in the same pipeline (Kafka deployed on-premise or even in GKE). There are open-source plugins to connect Kafka to GCP, like <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/hub/confluentinc/kafka-connect-gcp-pubsub\">Kafka Connect</a>.</p><p>Pub/Sub guarantees that every message will be delivered at least once but it does not guarantee that messages will be processed in order. It is usually connected to Dataflow to process the data, ensure that the messages are processed in order, and so on.</p><p>Pub/Sub support both push and pull modes:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Push.</strong></strong> Messages are sent to subscribers, resulting in lower latency.</li><li><strong><strong>Pull.</strong></strong> Subscribers pull messages from topics, better suited for a large volume of messages.</li></ul><h3 id=\"cloud-pub-sub-vs-cloud-task\"><strong>Cloud Pub/Sub vs Cloud Task</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs\">Cloud Tasks</a> is another fully-managed service to execute tasks asynchronously and manage messages between services. However, there are differences between Cloud Tasks and Pub/Sub:</p><ul><li>In Pub/Sub, publishers and subscribers are decoupled. Publishers know nothing about their subscribers. When they publish a message, they implicitly cause one or multiple subscribers to react to a publishing event.</li><li>In Cloud Tasks, the publisher stays in control of the execution. Besides, Cloud Tasks provide other features unavailable for Pub/Sub like scheduling specific delivery times, delivery rate controls, configurable retries, access and management of individual tasks in a queue, task/message creation deduplication.</li></ul><p>For more details, check out this <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/comp-pub-sub\">link</a>.</p><h3 id=\"cloud-dataflow\"><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/\">Cloud Dataflow</a></strong></h3><p>Cloud Dataflow is Google's managed service for <strong><strong>stream and batch data processing</strong></strong>, based on <a href=\"https://beam.apache.org/documentation/\">Apache Beam</a>. </p><p>You can define pipelines that will transform your data, for example before it is ingested in another service like BigQuery, BigTable, or Cloud ML. The same pipeline can process both stream and batch data.</p><p>A common pattern is to stream data into Pub/Sub, let's say from <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot\">IoT devices</a>, process it in Dataflow, and store it for analysis in BigQuery. </p><p>But Pub/Sub does not guarantee that the order in which messages are pushed to the topics will be the order in which the messages are consumed.

If you get stuck, the following questions might help:</p><ul><li>The platform needs to collect real-time events from the game:</li><li>Where might be the game running?</li><li>How can you ingest streaming data from the game into GCP?</li><li>How can you store it?</li><li>How can you collect and store the uploads of batches of data?</li><li>Can you analyze all the ingested data as it comes? Does it need to be processed?</li><li>What services can you use to analyze the data? How would this change if low-latency was now a new requirement?</li></ul><p>I have purposely defined the problem in a very vague way. This is what you can expect when you are facing this sort of challenge: uncertainty. It is part of your job to gather requirements and document your assumptions.</p><p>Do not worry if your solution does not look like <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/mobile/mobile-gaming-analysis-telemetry\">Google's</a>.
