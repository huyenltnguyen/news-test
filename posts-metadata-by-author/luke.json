   \n<p>One night in June, 2017 I stumbled across a website called <a href=\"http://freecodecamp.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">freecodecamp.org</a>. I was a teacher at the time who was looking for a career change. But I assumed being a programmer was out of my reach.</p><p>After all, I didn’t consider myself a math whiz, never went to school for computer science, and felt I was too old to get into coding. </p><p>Thankfully, freeCodeCamp helped me take my first steps toward becoming a developer, and I soon shed each of those self-limiting thoughts. </p><p>Now, as a Samsung software engineer and three-time certified AWS developer, I look back at those nights and weekends I spent working through the freeCodeCamp curriculum and see them as a major contributor to my successful work transition and my accomplishments as a programmer. </p><p>With my teacher-heart still present, though, I wrote this post to encourage other freeCodeCamp students to continue with their learning as well as to supplement their freeCodeCamp curriculum. </p><p>Familiarity with cloud computing, like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, is an increasingly present requirement in job postings. </p><p>This post will give any newbie who is still working through freeCodeCamp’s curriculum a simple introduction into the vast world of cloud computing. I'll show you how to take one of your freeCodeCamp front end projects and deploy it on AWS in a variety of ways. </p><p>Enjoy, and thank you freeCodeCamp!</p><h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2><p>The point of this post is to extend your learning from the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/\">Front End Development Libraries Projects</a> portion of the freeCodeCamp curriculum by deploying them to AWS. </p><p>So the prerequisites are:</p><ol><li>finish one of the Front End Libraries Project challenges</li><li>have an AWS account (go <a href=\"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start\">here</a> to sign up)</li></ol><h2 id=\"why-deploy-your-project-to-aws\">Why Deploy Your Project to AWS?</h2><p>As you work through the freeCodeCamp curriculum and you finish your Front End Libraries Projects, you submit those projects via CodePen where freeCodeCamp has a series of <a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/unit-testing-guide.html\">unit tests</a> to verify that you correctly completed their user stories. </p><p>Confetti falls, you see some inspirational phrase, and you’re probably very proud of your project. You might even want to share that accomplishment with your friends and family. </p><p>Sure, you could share your CodePen link with them, but in the real world when a company finishes a project they don’t make it available via CodePen – they deploy it. So, let’s do that too!</p><p>Just a quick note: when I say “deploy”, I mean taking your code from a local environment (your computer, or the freeCodeCamp or CodePen editors) and putting it on a server. That server, which is just another computer, is networked in such a way for the world to access your site.</p><p>If you wanted to, you could <a href=\"https://makeawebsitehub.com/host-website-computer/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">set up</a> a pc in your home and do the proper networking for it to serve your project to the world. Or, you could subscribe to a <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-web-hosting-services\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hosting</a> company for them to serve your website for you. </p><p>There are a variety of approaches to deploy code, but one very popular method is to use a cloud computing platform like Amazon Web Services (AWS). More on that next.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-aws-a-brief-intro-to-the-cloud\">What is AWS? A Brief Intro to the Cloud</h2><p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a “cloud computing platform”. That’s a little jargon with a lot packed into it. Let’s unpack.</p><p>AWS has services ranging from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc=sn&amp;loc=1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">simply storing files</a>, <a href=\"http://aws.amazonaws.com/aws/ec2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">running servers</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">converting speech to text</a> or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/polly/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">text to speech</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">machine learning</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">private cloud networks</a>, and about 200+ other services.</p><p>The basic idea behind cloud computing is to gain on-demand IT resources. The alternative, like we talked about earlier, is for you to own those IT resources. </p><p>There are a number of benefits to using a cloud computing platform instead of owning, one of the main ones being the cost savings.</p><p>Imagine trying to pay for all the physical IT resources that it would take to run the 200+ services AWS offers. That upfront cost is something most companies cannot afford, and fewer could pay for the engineers to configure. </p><p>Also, since the resources are on-demand, cloud platforms allows you to launch resources much faster than an IT department could. </p><p>In short, with a cloud computing platform like AWS you save on cost and deployment time, plus many more benefits not the least of which is security. Needless to say, cloud computing is the new sexy approach to IT and AWS is leading the pack.</p><p>Why does this matter to you? If you intend to pursue a career in development, regardless of your focus (backend, frontend, web technologies, mobile apps, gaming, desktop applications, and so on) you will find that many job postings include a reference to cloud compute platform experience. </p><p>So the more you can become familiar with one, like AWS, the more you’ll separate yourself from other candidates.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-deploy-your-freecodecamp-project-with-aws-s3\">How to Deploy your freeCodeCamp Project with AWS S3</h1><h2 id=\"what-is-aws-s3\">What is AWS S3?</h2><p>Throughout this post we’ll deploy your freeCodeCamp front end project using various services on AWS. </p><p>Our first approach is through the AWS service called S3. S3 stands for Simple Storage Solution. As you might have guessed from that name, the service lets you simply store stuff, more specifically <strong>objects</strong>.</p><p>You can find tutorials and courses on S3 that are hours and days long. On the surface though, it’s just a place where you can store objects. Objects can be things like image files, video files, even HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. </p><p>As you dive deeper into S3, you’ll learn that S3 allows you to do a lot of things to and with those objects. But for our project, we just want to learn how to store objects and look at a single one of those deeper features – using S3 as a website hosting service. </p><p>Thats right, AWS S3 is a service we can use to deploy a website.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-get-your-project-ready-for-deployment\">How to Get Your Project Ready for Deployment</h2><p>Throughout this post, I’ll be using the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Random Quote Machine</a> project. I am using the code from the example provided in the instructions. </p><p>We need to take your CSS, HTML, and JS code from CodePen and put them into their own separate files in a text editor.</p><h3 id=\"open-your-ide-for-example-visual-studio-code-\">Open Your IDE (for example, Visual Studio Code)</h3><p>In the CodePen environment, CodePen links your CSS to your HTML code, as well as your JS file to your HTML. We need to account for this before we deploy to S3, so we are going to test locally first.</p><p>Open your editor of choice, and create a new directory (folder) to hold your three CodePen files. I called mine <em><em>random-quote-machine</em></em>.

You should be very proud!</p><h2 id=\"more-on-s3\">More on S3</h2><p>Configuring an S3 bucket to be a website endpoint is just one of many ways to use S3. We could also use S3 to store data that we want to pull into an application. For example, the quotes on our Random Quote Machine could be stored in S3 as a <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JSON</a> file, and then our front end could request them. </p><p>That might seem like an odd adjustment to make when they could just be listed in our main.js file. But if we had other apps that needed access to those quotes then S3 could act as a central repository for them. </p><p>This is in fact the most popular way to use S3, as a data store for applications. We could also use the Glacier option of S3 to archive objects that we don’t anticipate accessing frequently, which would save us money from the standard S3 bucket configuration. </p><p>One last idea, though not the last way to use S3, is that we could save logs from a running application to an S3 bucket so that if there was a bug we could inspect those logs to help identify the source of the problem.</p><p>Whatever the use case, the concept of S3 is the same: we are storing objects in a bucket and those objects have permission settings to determine who can view, edit, or delete them (remember, we set our files to be publicly readable).</p><h2 id=\"next-up-\">Next Up!</h2><p>As stated before, AWS has hundreds of services, which means there are sometimes multiple ways to do a job. We walked through one way to host a site, but there are two more worth noting that will help you gain more exposure to AWS as a whole.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-deploy-your-freecodecamp-project-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk\">How to Deploy your freeCodeCamp Project with AWS Elastic Beanstalk</h1><p>Now we're going to learn more about the AWS cloud platform services and see an alternative way to deploy your code so you can experience more that AWS has to offer. </p><p>Specifically, we are going to get an introduction into several of the core AWS services and resources: EC2s, Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups, and Security Groups. </p><p>Wow, that’s a lot of topics to cover.

The nice thing about cloud computing platforms is that the configuration of that server can be done for us if we want.</p><p>Consider our S3 deployment for a second. Our files were stored on a machine owned by AWS, and AWS took care of configuring that computer to serve the<em><em> </em></em>index.html page and give us an endpoint for viewing the project. </p><p>Aside from telling S3 the name of our index.html file, we did none of that configuration and yet we still walked away with a deployed project and an endpoint to view it.</p><p>When we use Elastic Beanstalk, it will similarly include AWS handling a lot of configuration for us. But this time we are also going to do a bit of configuring ourselves. </p><p>By doing this, we will see an alternative and very popular method for deploying a web application. This time, we will add code that “serves” the index.html but we’ll let AWS handle the launching of the hardware and giving us an endpoint to view our project.</p><h2 id=\"let-s-configure-\">Let’s Configure!</h2><p>We are going to add some code to our project to serve our index.html.

But I’ll also provide a brief introduction explaining why and how we are using Node and Express.</p><h3 id=\"why-use-node\">Why Use Node?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/lukemiller.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-3.png?resize=480%2C240&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"download-3\" width=\"480\" height=\"240\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime for server-side applications. That is a lot of jargon, so let’s break it down a bit.</p><p>“Node is a JavaScript runtime” – a runtime, in the world of programming, is an execution model. In other words, it is a process that implements how to execute code. So, Node, is a process that implements how to execute JavaScript code. </p><p>When we have JavaScript code like this:</p><pre><code>console.log(\"Hello World\")</code></pre><p>Node knows what to do with that code.</p><p>“…for server-side applications”- remember that we are trying to deploy our code to be served by a server, and that a server is just a computer. Also, note that a server is different from a client, and in the case of a website the client is the web browser. </p><p>When you open your project in a web browser, the browser handles reading the index.html, main.js, and styles.css files. That’s right, the browser (client) knows how to read and execute JavaScript code, so that when it sees <code>console.log(\"Hello World\")</code> it knows what to do. </p><p>Our main.js file is JavaScript code that is being run client-side, by the browser. But, Node is for server-side JavaScript. So, your browser knows how to run that JavaScript code, but how does the computer that serves our website know how to run JavaScript? Node.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/lukemiller.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-4.png?resize=596%2C289&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"download-4\" width=\"596\" height=\"289\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>JavaScript can run on the client (ie: web browser) and server</figcaption></figure><p>So, all together, “Node is a JavaScript runtime for server-side applications” means that Node is a process for implementing how to execute JavaScript code on a server, as opposed to a client like a web browser. </p><p>Without Node, the computer/server does not know how to run JavaScript code.</p><h3 id=\"why-use-express\">Why Use Express?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/lukemiller.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-5.png?resize=435%2C157&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"download-5\" width=\"435\" height=\"157\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Expres.js a web application framework for Node.js</figcaption></figure><p>While Node gives us the server-side runtime, which is that environment where we can run JavaScript code, Express gives us a framework for serving web applications.</p><p>When we deployed via S3, we told S3 the file name we wanted served (index.html). Now, Express will be where we configure what file we want served. </p><p>If we had a website with different routes (ie: www.example.com/home, /media, /about, /contact), then we might have different HTML files for each of those pages. We would use Express to manage serving those pages if the web browser requested them. </p><p>For example, when the web browser requested www.example.com/contact, Express would get that request from the browser and respond with contact.html.</p><h3 id=\"app-js\">app.js</h3><p>Now we know that Node is what lets us run JavaScript code on the server and Express is handling our requests from the browser. So let’s look in <code>fcc-to-aws-part2</code> at our <code>app.js</code> file and read it line by line to understand what we’ve added to our project.</p><p>First…</p><pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");</code></pre><p>This declares a variable called <code>express</code>, and then the <code>=</code> sign means we are assigning it a value. But what’s this <code>require(“express”)</code>?</p><p>The <code>require</code> function is just a function Node is aware of, and when Node sees it then Node will look for a folder in the <code>node_modules</code> folder by the same name. You have this <code>node_modules</code> folder in your <code>fcc-to-aws-part2</code> folder. </p><p>Once Node finds <code>express</code> inside the <code>node_modules</code> folder, it will import the code from the <code>express</code> folder and assign it to the variable we declared. This lets us use the code that comes from the <code>express</code> folder without having to write it ourselves. This importing code into our code is the concept of modules.</p><p>A module is just a bundle of code. It could be one line long or much longer. Therefore, a <code>NODE_module</code> (emphasis added to node) is a bundle of code that can run in the Node runtime. We are using, or <code>require</code>-ing, the <code>express</code> module.</p><p>The <code>express</code> module is the Express.js web application framework we discussed earlier. </p><p>I won’t got into how to add modules to the <code>node_modules</code> folder, but for now know that by declaring the variable <code>express</code> and using the <code>require(“express”)</code> syntax, we are bringing in that Express.js framework and making it accessible via the variable we assigned it to.</p><p>There was a lot packed into those previous four paragraphs, I recommend slowing down and reading it again to make sure you really got it!</p><p>Next up…</p><pre><code>const path = require(\"path\");</code></pre><p>Ah! This should look familiar now. We are bringing in another module, this time the <code>path</code> module. We’re assigning it to the <code>path</code> variable. </p><p>You might have noticed a pattern that the variable name we use matches the module name. It doesn’t have to be that way. We could assign the<em><em> </em></em><code>path</code> module to the <code>foobar</code> variable. But it makes more sense to name it what it is.</p><p>What does the <code>path</code> module do? It is a module (just a bundle of code) that lets us work with file and folder paths. This way we can use a JavaScript syntax that Node understands in order to access files/folders on our server. That will come in handy when we want to reference where index.html is located in our project.</p><p>Alright, moving on…</p><pre><code>const app = express();</code></pre><p>Express, again? That’s right. The first time we were just importing the module, now we are using it. </p><p>To use the Express framework we have to instantiate it, meaning we have to run this express function, <code>express()</code>, and now we’re assigning it to the <code>app</code> variable.</p><p>“Whoa, but Luke, why not have this line of code right after the earlier <code>express</code> line of code?”</p><p>Good question. It is a common pattern to import (or use <code>require()</code>) all the modules you’ll need at the top of your code, and then use them after you’re done importing.</p><p>Now for the big banana…</p><pre><code>app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \"public\")));</code></pre><p>Whoa there! Let’s break this apart a little.</p><p>First, we are calling a function, the <code>app.use()</code> function. This is telling our Express application that we want to USE another function in our app. Makes sense. </p><p>The function we are telling Express that we want run is the <code>express.static()</code> function being called inside of the <code>.use()</code> function parameter. So, <code>app.use()</code> is telling Express we want to use some code in the app, and specifically here we are wanting to USE <code>express.static(path.join(__dirname, “public”))</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>express.static()</code> is an Express function which we can use since it’s part of the module that we imported and assigned to the <code>express</code> variable.</p><p>The <code>.static()</code> function handles serving static files. I hope your ears perked up and eyes opened wide! I’ll say it again. The <code>.static()</code> function handles SERVING static files. Serving! </p><p>Remember, in this deployment approach we are handling a bit more of the configuration to SERVE our project. Here is the Express function that we are using to say, “I want to serve some static files”. Static files means our index.html file.</p><p>So, <code>app.use()</code> was saying, “Hey, I want to run some code for this app inside my function parameter”. Specifically we want to run <code>express.static()</code> which says, “I want to deliver static files, like an index.html”, and then its function parameter tells us where to find those static files. </p><p>So let’s look at <code>path.join(__dirname, “public”)</code> to understand how it’s telling us where our static files are.</p><p>Earlier we imported the <code>path</code> module to be able to access files in our server/computer. </p><p>Well, we want to access the index.html file, which is the public folder. We use the <code>path</code> function <code>.join()</code> to say, “hey, from our current directory (or, folder), go to the public folder to find the files I want”. That will return the index.html, main.js, and styles.css to the <code>express.static()</code>, which will return to the<em><em> </em></em><code>app.use()</code> function that is handling what files to serve (SERVE!) our visitors.</p><p>All together now!</p><p><code>app.use()</code> = “when the browser requests the app, I want to run <code>express.static()</code>\"</p><p><code>express.static()</code> = “I am going to deliver some static files and they are located here…\"</p><p><code>path.join(__dirname, “public”)</code> =<em><em> </em></em>“grab the files in the public folder”</p><p>Yay! We did it! We configured out Express app running in the Node runtime to deliver the index.html, main.js, and styles.css files when someone visits our site.</p><p>But wait…there’s more:</p><pre><code>const port = 8080;\napp.listen(port);</code></pre><p>Remember that the <code>app</code> variable is our instance of the Express framework. The <code>.listen()</code> function is the app telling the computer, “hey, any requests made on port 8080, bring them my way!” </p><p>Ports and sockets are a more advanced topic, so we won’t get into it now. But just know that a computer/server has many ports, which are like access points, and we are configuring Node/Express app to only listen to one access point, 8080.</p><p>Lastly…</p><pre><code>console.log(\"listening on port: \" + port);</code></pre><p>This is standard practice for Express apps, where we are just logging out on the computer what port we’re running. It gives us some verification that the Express application works.</p><p>Great job! That was a lot of code to walk through. </p><p>Now, if you’re familiar enough with how to navigate via a terminal, we can test this Express app locally on our computer before moving on to AWS. Ensuring it works locally before we go to AWS will help us in case we have errors in AWS because we’ll know the errors can’t be related to our Express app not working.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-test-our-node-express-js-app\">How to Test Our Node/Express.js App</h3><p>If you open the package.json file, you’ll see a “scripts” section. This<em><em> </em></em>package.json file is metadata for our Node application, and it also can contain configurable commands to run in the “scripts” section. </p><p>I’ve included the “start” script, which runs the app.js file in the Node environment, which in turn runs our Express.js code we just discussed. This “start” script is how we run our project.</p><p>To test this out, in your terminal navigate to our <code>fcc-to-aws-part2</code> folder, enter <code>npm start</code> to start the app.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/lukemiller.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/term.png?resize=640%2C28&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"term\" width=\"640\" height=\"28\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Terminal command to run our app</figcaption></figure><p>After running that command, you should immediately see our <code>console.log()</code> message informing us that the app is running on port 8080.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/lukemiller.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/term-1.png?resize=640%2C68&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"term-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"68\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>You should see the “listening on port: 8080” message to know it’s running</figcaption></figure><p>Now, to view your project, open a web browser and enter localhost:8080 in your address bar and click Enter.

Our local computer is acting as the server at the moment, but we want anyone in the world to be able to view our project and they can’t do that via our localhost:8080 address. </p><p>So, we are going to use AWS to host a server for us, put our app on it, and then let AWS manage the configuration necessary to generate the URL endpoint for the world to access. That’s where the AWS service called Elastic Beanstalk comes into play. Let’s get to it!</p><h2 id=\"go-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk\">Go to AWS Elastic Beanstalk</h2><p>After logging into your AWS account, search for the Elastic Beanstalk service in the top search bar.

This EC2, again, is just a computer running in some AWS site that has your code on it. The EC2 was launched by Elastic Beanstalk for us.</p><h3 id=\"load-balancer\">Load Balancer</h3><p>Not only did the Elastic Beanstalk create an EC2 Instance for us, it also created a Load Balancer for us. In the EC2 Management Console, on the left navigation panel scroll down to <strong>Load Balancers</strong> and click the link to see the one made for you.</p><p>A load balancer’s purpose is to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets. That target in our case is an EC2, but we only have one running, so a load balancer is not all that useful at the moment. </p><p>Let’s pretend for a moment that our app went viral and we had tens of thousands of people trying to access the endpoint Elastic Beanstalk gave us. That single EC2 Instance would be overwhelmed with traffic. Requests would timeout, visitors would get frustrated, and our site would suffer since we don’t have enough EC2s to handle the load.</p><p>But! If we DID have more EC2 Instances running, each with our project deployed on it, we’d be able to handle going viral. </p><p>Though there is a problem that arises from having mulitple EC2s. We need each EC2 instance to be reachable by that same Elastic Beanstalk endpoint, and that’s tricky networking. </p><p>That’s where the Load Balancer comes in. It provides a single access point for our Elastic Beanstalk to target, and the Load Balancer then handles keeping traffic organized between the different EC2s and the Beanstalk.</p><p>If you look at your Load Balancers <strong>Basic Configuration</strong>, you’ll see a<strong> DNS Name</strong>, which looks a lot like the Elastic Beanstalk endpoint. If you open it, your app should run. That’s because the Elastic Beanstalk endpoint actually points to this endpoint which is able to balance traffic among multiple endpoints.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-9.36.01-PM--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-9.36.01-PM--1-\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-9.36.01-PM--1-.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-9.36.01-PM--1-.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-9.36.01-PM--1-.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-9.36.01-PM--1-.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"913\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Load Balancer view in the EC2 Management Console</figcaption></figure><p>Now, you might be wondering “Luke, how do I get more EC2s to launch so that I can capitalize on this sweet load balancing action?” Glad you asked!

Enter, CloudWatch.</p><h3 id=\"cloudwatch\">CloudWatch</h3><p>If you click on the <strong>Monitoring</strong> tab in your Auto Scaling Group, you’ll see links that will take you to CloudWatch. Once in the CloudWatch Management Console, you’ll see a variety of AWS services and resources listed and their associated metrics. </p><p>Browsing through the list you’ll find EC2 and Auto Scaling Group, and monitoring details for each. Where did all of these metrics come from? AWS provides them for your automatically, along with this helpful dashboard, allowing us to do some pretty cool dynamic networking and programming based on individual metrics or a composite, such as Auto Scaling.</p><p>The Auto Scaling Group we have has access to these metrics, and watches the NetworkOut metric of our EC2 Instances to determine if a scaling in/out action should occur.</p><p>Just another example of the leverage we gain from a cloud computing platform.</p><h2 id=\"elasticbeanstalk-deployment-recap\">ElasticBeanstalk Deployment Recap</h2><p>We took a look at a second method for deploying an application: Elastic Beanstalk. Compared to our S3 deployment, this route required us to add more code for configuring the serving of our index.html. </p><p>We used Express.js, a Node.js web application framework, to serve our front end, and then uploaded our newly updated project to Elastic Beanstalk. This in turn launched a myriad of AWS resources and services for us. </p><p>We learned about EC2, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Group, and CloudWatch, and how they work together to deliver our project by a globally accessible url endpoint. </p><p>There are even more settings, services, and resources Elastic Beanstalk configuring and provisioned for us that we did not discuss, but for now you’ve gained a good first step into the benefits of a cloud hosting provider and a few of the key AWS services.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-deploy-your-freecodecamp-project-with-aws-lambda\">How to Deploy Your freeCodeCamp Project with AWS Lambda</h1><p>For our final part of this post, we are going to deploy our code to a serverless environment. Serverless infrastructures are becoming increasingly popular and preferred over a dedicated on-premise server or even a hosted server (like EC2). </p><p>Not only is the serverless route more cost-effective, it lends itself to a different software architectural approach: microservices. </p><p>To gain an introduction into the serverless world, we are going to deploy our code via AWS’s serverless service called Lambda and another AWS service, API Gateway. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=\"what-is-serverless-\">What is Serverless?!</h2><p><em><em>Say, what?!</em></em> This whole time we’ve been talking about servers delivering our code when the web browser requests it, so what’s <em><em>serverless</em></em> mean?</p><p>To start off, it doesn’t mean there is no server. There has to be one, since a server is a computer and we need our program running on a computer. </p><p>So, serverless doesn’t mean no-server. It means you and I, the code deployers, do not ever see the server and have no configurations to set for that server. The server belongs to AWS, and it just runs our code without us doing anything else. </p><p>Serverless means that for you and me in all practicality there is no server, but in reality there is.</p><p>Sounds pretty simple, right? It is! We have no server to configure, AWS has the server and handles everything. We just hand over the code.</p><p>You might be asking yourself, how is that different from EC2? Good question.</p><h3 id=\"there-s-less-configuration\">There's Less Configuration</h3><p>Do you remember all the configuration options that we could mess with on Elastic Beanstalk, and in the EC2 management console, and the Auto Scaling Group, and the Load Balancer?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/lukemiller.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-11.34.14-AM-1.png?resize=640%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2021-04-02-at-11.34.14-AM-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Some of the Elastic Beanstalk configurations available to us</figcaption></figure><p>Then, Elastic Beanstalk created more resources all with their own configurations, like the Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group.</p><p>Well, as nice as it is that we <em><em>can </em></em>configure those, it can also be a pain to setup. More importantly, it takes more time to setup, which takes us away from time spent developing our actual application. </p><p>With a Lambda (an AWS serverless service), we just say, “<em><em>hey, we want a Node.js environment to run our code</em></em>“, and then after that there is no more configurations to make about the server itself. We can get back to writing more code.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-cheaper\">It's Cheaper</h3><p>Also, that EC2 is costing us money for as long as it runs. Now it’s simple to terminate or temporarily stop to save us money, and is usually cheaper than purchasing your own physical server – but it still costs money at all times of the day that it’s running, even if no one is trying to reach your website. </p><p>So, what if there was an option that only charged us a fee for the time the code ran? That’s serverless!</p><p>With AWS Lambda, we have our code able to be run at any time, it’s sitting on a server. But it only runs our program when asked for and we are only paying for those times it runs. The cost savings are huge.</p><h3 id=\"microservice-architecture\">Microservice Architecture</h3><p>Because most programs have been written and deployed onto a server to run, all the code for that application has been bundled together so that that server could access and run the entire application. That makes sense! </p><p>But, if you have a way to run code with a serverless approach, which only runs that code asked for, you could break up that one application into many applications. That breaking apart an application into smaller sub-applications is the idea of microservices.</p><p>One of the main benefits of a microservice approach is the update process. If we have a monolithic application (one that is all bundled together on an EC2), and need to update one small piece of code, then we have to redeploy the entire application, which may mean service interruptions. </p><p>Alternatively, a microservice approach means we only update the minor-application of the whole that deals with that small piece of code. This is a less abrupt approach to deployment, and one of the primary benefits of a microservice approach that AWS Lambda allows us to do.</p><p>I should note that serverless has its own drawbacks as well. For starters, if you have a microservice architecture via serverless, then the integration of those microservices to talk to each other requires extra work that a monolithic application doesn’t have to deal with. </p><p>That being said, it’s an approach that is massively popular and growing in use, so it’s worth your knowing.</p><p><em><em>Disclaimer: Now, technically Part 1’s use of S3 was a serverless deployment, but typically when people discuss serverless and AWS they’re talking about Lambda.</em></em></p><h2 id=\"how-to-get-started-with-aws-lambda\">How to Get Started with AWS Lambda</h2><p>So, Lambdas allow us to execute code without worrying about server configuration or cost. That’s it. They run on a server owned by AWS, configured by AWS, managed by AWS, and never seen by us. </p><p>For the most part, all we control and care about is the function. This is what’s referred to as <em><em>function as a service</em></em> in cloud computing. It lets us focus on code without needing to think about the complexities of infrastructure.</p><p>So now that we know that Lambdas are just functions running on an AWS server that we don’t have to configure, let’s get started with ours.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-create-our-lambda\">How to Create Our Lambda</h3><p>Head over to the AWS Lambda Management Console.

Instead of using the <code>&lt;link href=\"styles.css\" /&gt;</code> tag and the <code>&lt;script src=\"main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag in our freeCodeCamp project’s index.htm<em><em>l</em></em> that links our .css and .js code to our HTML code, we are going to add them directly into the HTML file. </p><p>If we don’t do this, then when we try to open our app, it will look for those files at a different URL route than we want.</p><p>To change the code to work for us in Lambda, do the following:</p><ol><li>Replace the <code>&lt;link href=\"styles.css\"/&gt;</code> line in your index.htm<em><em>l</em></em> file with <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> (this should be right above your <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> opening tag)</li><li>Open your <code>styles.css</code> file, copy all of the CSS, and paste it between the two <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags (like <code>&lt;style&gt; <em><em>your pasted code</em></em> &lt;/style&gt;</code>).</li><li>Do the same thing with our <code>main.js</code> – remove the <code>src=\"main.js\"</code> inside the opening <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</li><li>Open your main.js file, copy all of your JS code, and paste it between the two <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags at the bottom of our<em><em> </em></em>index.html file (ie: <code>&lt;script&gt; <em><em>your main.js code </em></em>&lt;script&gt;</code>)</li></ol><p>Once completed, open your index.htm<em><em>l</em></em> locally in the web browser to make sure your project still works before moving on.</p><h3 id=\"add-our-project-s-code-to-our-lambda\">Add Our Project’s Code to Our Lambda</h3><p>With our updated index.html page working, head back to our Lambda console. There, paste all of your index.html code into the index.html file you created in the Lambda. Double check to make sure you copied/pasted all of your code.</p><h3 id=\"update-index-js-lambda-file\">Update index.js Lambda File</h3><p>Okay, we have our index.html, but, just like with the Express.js app we made in the ElasticBeanstalk deployment, we need to tell the Lambda where that file is that we want delivered to the web browser. </p><p>Copy and paste the following code into your Lambda’s index.js file, and then we’ll discuss it.</p><pre><code>const fs = require('fs');\n\nexports.handler = async (event) =&gt; {\n    const contents = fs.readFileSync(`index.html`);\n    return {\n        statusCode: 200,\n        body: contents.toString(),\n        headers: {\"content-type\": \"text/html\"}\n    }\n};</code></pre><p>The top of this code should look familiar to you if you completed the ElasticBeanstalk deployment. We’re importing a node module called <code>fs</code>, which is short for file system. It lets us traverse our file system, in our case to find our index.html file.</p><p>You’ll notice the <code>exports.handler</code> function, that is an out-of-the-box function given to us that this Lambda is configured to look for. </p><p>When this Lambda is triggered (more on that in a second), it looks for the designated file and function name to run. When we clicked <strong>Create Function</strong>, it came pre-configured to look in the index.js file for the <code>handler</code> function. </p><p>We could change this if we want to, but for now it’s good enough to know that this <code>handler</code> function is our Lambda function.</p><p>The function reads our index.html files, assigns it to a variable called <code>contents</code>, and then returns it.</p><p>The way it returns it is specific for an API request. That’s how our Lambda is going to be triggered. By opening the project in a browser the browser is making a GET request to an endpoint which will trigger this Lambda to return the index.html to the browser. </p><p>Let’s go create our API to trigger our Lambda to return the index.html file to the browser.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Before we move on, click on the <strong>Deploy Changes</strong> button. This saves our Lambda.</p><h2 id=\"aws-api-gateway\">AWS API Gateway</h2><p>In the AWS services search bar, type API Gateway, and open the link.
