I was trying to achieve my dream, but the pandemic actually made the process faster for me. </p><p>I say this, because without the pandemic, maybe it would have taken me longer to decide to move forward and feel prepared to take the next step in my career.</p><h2 id=\"a-little-background-about-me-and-my-passion-for-software-development\">A little background about me and my passion for software development</h2><p>I was born in Romania, and in High School I started to work as a journalist in Radio and TV for about 5 years. </p><p>After 2 years at University in Computer Science, I moved to Italy where I lived for 12 years. At first I worked as a translator, and then as a Web Developer and Designer. And I also worked as a journalist for a magazine for 5 years in my free time.</p><p>My teenage dream to move to the USA finally came true in 2013. Shortly after the move, I started to volunteer as a translator and IT Department. Then continued to work as a Web Developer and Designer for a company. I became a US citizen in 2018 and started my career as a Remote Freelancer Full Stack Developer.</p><p>In 2017 I joined the GDG Capital Region. In February 2019 I became a <strong><a href=\"http://devfest.gdgcapitalregion.com/\">Google Developer Group Lead</a></strong> and I was nominated as a <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/international-womens-day-2019-celebration/\"><strong>Women Techmakers Ambassador</strong></a>. </p><p>This was the first step to getting more involved with women in coding events and meetups.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-5.18.04-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-5.18.04-PM\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-5.18.04-PM.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-5.18.04-PM.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-5.18.04-PM.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-5.18.04-PM.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1053\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Traveling across Europe and the US: living, working and studying</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-next-steps-coding-bootcamp-meetups-and-winning-a-hackathon\">The Next Steps: <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-joining-coding-bootcamps-meetups-and-winning-a-hackathon-changed-my-life-completely-2addc66f1665/\">Coding bootcamp, Meetups, and Winning a Hackathon</a></h2><h3 id=\"the-school-of-life\">The School of Life</h3><p>The world of software development, and technology in general, moves so fast. So it is not easy to be on the top unless you are willing to upskill all the time. </p><p>My biggest issue was my technical English proficiency, which made it difficult for me to explain what I needed to say during job interviews.</p><p>Even though I had studied some Computer Science at University, I decided to leave it behind and find my way in the world. I blamed myself for years for my decision to give up on my dream of graduating. </p><p>But looking back now I feel better, because I achieved much more than if I had only lived in one country. I had the opportunity to live in different places and change continents. Along with that, I had the opportunity to learn new languages. I enjoyed traveling the world, making new friends, pursuing different interesting jobs, and so on.</p><p>It was not easy, though – and many times I just wanted to give up on everything. It was challenging every day. I thought I would never make it, that I'd never be able to learn to speak any other language because in school I was so bad at learning foreign languages. But I did it.</p><h3 id=\"my-first-experience-with-web-development-and-design\">My first experience with Web Development and Design</h3><p>During my career I've held all sorts of IT positions and have had all kinds of roles from hardware to software, depending on what was available. </p><p>I discovered over the years that I most enjoyed Web Development and Design, a fact which weighed heavily in my final decision.<br><br>I got to get my hands dirty with Web Development and Design for the first time during my job in Italy. </p><p>The company had a monthly magazine that they printed out. I was able to transform it into a digital format and distribute it on the private area of the website that I created for their associates. </p><p>I was able to develop the website from a static 5 pages to a fully functional website with daily updates and a private area. I then continued by building a new website dedicated to the magazine itself. </p><p>I had to learn everything from scratch by googling when I needed to figure something out.</p><h3 id=\"the-american-dream-come-true\">The American Dream come true</h3><p>When I moved to the US, my web development experience came in handy. I used to work for a company as a Web Developer and Designer. I was in charge of maintaining and updating four websites and three intranet sites. I also created two new websites using mainly PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery and so on. </p><p>I also got involved updating the company's brochures, posters, flyers, catalogs, logos (Adobe Creative Suite) and Adobe PDF forms. <br><br>After working with them for four years, I was looking to start my own business. I started reading books about Freelancing and found out more about it. I even joined the Union Freelancers in 2018 which offers services and consultancy to freelancers.</p><h3 id=\"building-up-a-portfolio\">Building up a portfolio</h3><p>Having prior experience helped me start Freelancing in late 2018 as a Web Developer and Designer. </p><p>It also made it easier for me to create my own website with a <strong><a href=\"https://linda-kovacs.com/portfolio/\">portfolio</a></strong>. There I display my professional projects that I worked on and the ones I studied from FreeCodeCamp, AlbanyCanCode, Hack Upstate/CareersInCode, and Practicum.</p><p>I really enjoyed being a freelancer. The only part I started to dislike was dealing with all the paperwork such as contracts, health insurance, taxes and so on – all things that used English that I wasn't familiar with. </p><p>That’s when I started to think about applying for jobs at big companies again. I would have career growth opportunities, and I wouldn't have to deal with stuff I don’t like such as bureaucracy forms and contracts.</p><h2 id=\"my-freecodecamp-experience\">My freeCodeCamp Experience</h2><p>I’m a self-taught Web Developer and Designer, and in 2016 I started learning new coding languages like ES6, React, NodeJS on <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/lindakovacs\"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a>. I got four out of five certifications (now there are even more) and built most of the projects that come with the certifications, about 16 in total. </p><p>It took me about two years to go through the curriculum and build the projects. It was my foundation for my newly updated coding skills. </p><p>While going through the freeCodeCamp curriculum I was also working as a Web Developer and Designer as my full time job.

So I joined their Web Developer Professional Certificate Program.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/69336343_10220534615701878_4928451435739217920_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&amp;ccb=2&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=79av-TTpGZgAX8Z_P7c&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.xx&amp;oh=2b402ef06788348944f1c6ca495effe7&amp;oe=5FD6E3B4\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"69336343_10220534615701878_4928451435739217920_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&amp;ccb=2&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=79av-TTpGZgAX8Z_P7c&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Working remotely enjoying the beautiful days from my terrace in the backyard</figcaption></figure><p>When I joined the program I was convinced that my prior professional experience would make it easy for me to surf right through. But I was expecting to have some issues when we got to algorithms, JavaScript, React, NodeJs, Databases, and the back end parts. Those areas are often more challenging, even for developers with experience. </p><p>To my surprise, I got overwhelmed by things I thought I was good at before, like CSS. It’s true – I never knew about things like BEM, which blew my mind and at a certain point got me confused. It was hard and frustrating. &nbsp;</p><p>Code reusability is the main focus of the Bootcamp. And the Practicum curriculum made me a better Developer and Designer by augmenting my knowledge with the latest accessibility and Web standards.<br><br>Practicum’s curriculum is specially designed that after you go through the mostly theory-based lectures, you're dropped right into code-based challenges. This means that you have to find solutions that mirror real world experiences. </p><p>In addition to these challenges, the sprints also provided space for students to work on projects independently and as small groups.</p><p>The curriculum is geared toward helping you build your portfolio. You complete 15 projects by following the original mockup design files and adding functionality as instructed on each project. </p><p>You also collaborate through GitHub using a professional developer's workflow which will help you in your future developer job.</p><p>The program was 10 months long, and the review process and projects were designed to give participants real world work experience. Its goal is to prepare you to be ready to join any company’s developer team at any time. <br><br>But it wasn't easy. I felt like quitting every Sprint when I was working on the projects. I felt like I couldn’t make it to the end and I was so afraid of failing. I could've taken an academic leave to catch up, but I fought hard and stayed with my initial cohort.<br><br>Going through Practicum was an amazing experience. I learned so much in such a short time, and had the opportunity to put my skills to the test with sprints and bi-weekly projects. The experience is pretty tough, yet incredibly valuable.</p><p>Practicum also uses GitHub Pages to deploy the projects we created, which made it easier for me to display them publicly. This definitely helped me out, not only in showing my GitHub activity but also when displaying my final projects (which potential employers could see with just one click).</p><h2 id=\"and-then-the-coronavirus-pandemic-hit\">And Then the Coronavirus Pandemic Hit</h2><p>I realized that I needed a career change once the lockdown happened. Many people lost jobs and we learned how painful change can be. So I decided that now was the time for a career change, and it was time to level up my skills. </p><p>We already knew before the pandemic hit that everyone had to go digital. An online presence is a must nowadays, and data and the cloud are the future (and the present). </p><p>The lockdown just made the transition happen more quickly. And I knew that I needed to skill up continuously to stay on top of things. I needed to adapt rapidly and forget the conventional way, to think outside the box, be creative and inventive. </p><p>Look at Amazon and Uber, to name a few – and how much disruption they have created to the conventional way of doing things. This is the right time to make your move. Everything is available at your fingertips. Put in the time and make sacrifices and it will pay off soon.</p><p>I was a freelancer before the pandemic hit. I was lucky enough to get my clients from contacts and companies I met at GDG Meetups and from AlbanyCanCode. My business started to grow and I felt really proud of it. </p><p>But then of course the pandemic changed everything. And I learned that we truly are in this together.</p><h2 id=\"what-i-did-during-lockdown\">What I Did During Lockdown</h2><p>That’s when I started to assess the situation. I decided to take the time to invest in myself. I used the lockdown to reflect on what I needed to do to build up my skills. </p><p>I needed to hold myself accountable and stay motivated. That's where the developer community played a big role in my lockdown journey.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/Linda-Kovacs-Hack-Upstate-XV.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Linda-Kovacs-Hack-Upstate-XV\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Linda-Kovacs-Hack-Upstate-XV.jpg 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Linda-Kovacs-Hack-Upstate-XV.jpg 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Linda-Kovacs-Hack-Upstate-XV.jpg 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/Linda-Kovacs-Hack-Upstate-XV.jpg 2041w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1148\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Online GDG Meetups</figcaption></figure><p>I was literally only sleeping 4-5 hours a night and took every course I could find online.

And I started getting the attention of the hiring managers who began contacting me (and still are) about available positions. </p><p>This made it easier for me to apply for more targeted jobs where I knew my resume would be considered and I'd be able to get job interviews due to the exposure.</p><p>Helping others has definitely helped me. I’m not a person who likes to post in social networks, but if I'm posting with purpose then I’m always willing to do it.</p><p>This not only helped me, but helped our community as well. When I saw the LinkedIn testimonials of our community members who were celebrating passing their Google Cloud Engineer Certifications with the free online resources we shared, I felt so happy for their achievements.</p><h3 id=\"i-volunteered-in-the-developer-community\">I volunteered in the developer community</h3><p>As you can see, I am very active in the online tech community and I love helping others succeed. I’m always trying to spread whatever opportunities are available online. </p><p>I try to help with coding questions, and give career advice when I can. Sometimes I get more questions than I can handle and I have to defer some of them. And sometimes I have to prioritize and choose what I can do. We all have only 24 hours in a day – but I am a person who doesn’t like to say NO and that makes it difficult for me. </p><p>So I started to make choices based on the time I have available to dedicate to the community. This has helped me avoid burnout and getting overly stressed out over my own deadlines. </p><p>I like to help everyone out, but at the same time I get stressed when I need to meet my own deadlines in a short period of time. I had to learn the hard way that I am a human and I can do so much. Now that I've learned this, I can still be an active volunteer in the community and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"i-participated-in-google-s-elevate-community-training-program\">I participated in Google’s &lt;Elevate&gt; Community Training program</h3><p>During the lockdown I was presented with another great opportunity. I got to participate in Google’s &lt;Elevate&gt; Community Training program. Elevate is a 3-month program that provides training in areas like leadership, communication, critical thinking, and teamwork. </p><p>The program provided resources and content to help participants add to their skillset with applied skills sessions/workshops to help them take their professional careers to the next level. </p><p>This helped me identify ways to customize my LinkedIn profile to filter my job search. This way potential employers would see in my profile that I was open only for remote positions. </p><p>It also helped me improve my interviewing skills and polish up my resume, cover letters, and job search approach in general.</p><h3 id=\"i-joined-google-cloud-s-learning-workshop\">I joined Google Cloud's Learning Workshop</h3><p>I also joined a Google Cloud Workshop for 9 weeks to get ready for my Cloud certification. I got all the material I needed to get ready for the exam. For our final project before graduation, we worked on teams to build a Google Cloud solution as a project. And I did it!<br><br>All these programs and curricula – <strong>FreeCodeCamp, Practicum, AlbanyCanCode, HackUpstate, GDG Meetups, Google training</strong> (and the list goes on) – played an integral role in getting me where I am today. </p><h2 id=\"when-is-it-the-right-time-to-apply-for-jobs-and-remote-jobs-in-general\">When is it the right time to apply for jobs and remote jobs in general?</h2><p>This is the right moment for remote work – period! There are so many positions available that are not filled. The job market has changed and we need to adapt. </p><p>These sorts of changes have happened many times throughout history and our ability to change with them has played a big role in our success.</p><p>During my life, I've had dreams, big and small. I've always had a vision of everything in my mind and I write down my goals. I take action on those goals by completing small tasks and steps that help me accomplish my dreams. </p><p>But I've made a lot of sacrifices and it was not always easy. I always knew inside me that one day I would make it. If I find myself in a place or with people that are not what I was looking for, I just adjust my direction. </p><p>It’s just like walking in the woods with your compass – you take it out of your pocket to check it and adjust your trajectory every now and then so you arrive at your desired destination.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-prepare-for-interviews\">How to prepare for interviews</h3><p>So how much you have to prepare before you start applying for jobs? Well, my answer is to just start applying right now. You will prepare for your job interviews by interviewing. </p><p>Nobody gets better at driving just by reading books and watching videos – you need to start to drive! It's the same with interviewing. You need to start the process, first with companies that may not be your first choice, and then with those you'd love to work for. </p><p>This way you can test your skills and see how many calls you get back, how many interviews you get, and this will help you train for your dream job. </p><p>Keep in mind that you can also apply to your dream job company to get a feeling for their interview process. If you don’t get the offer the first time, you can prepare more thoroughly, level up your skills, and apply again later. </p><p>During the process, you'll get to know more about the company and the people and if you would like to work with them. </p><p>There were companies that I interviewed with that were on my dream list – but after the interview process I was disappointed and decided I actually didn't want to work with them. So I didn't reapply.</p><p>Really, interviewing is like dating: you don’t want to spend 8 hours a day in a toxic place with toxic people who will only destroy your life. You need to work in a place you like with people that you will enjoy being around. </p><h3 id=\"interviews-with-large-companies\">Interviews with large companies</h3><p>It was my dream to work at a large company like Google, Facebook, or Amazon – that’s why I always applied to all of them. And I got to go through the job interview process, too. </p><p>I didn’t make it to the end of all of them, but I got experience with the big company's interview processes. I got to test my resume to see if it passed the automatic scan process and reached a human. I also went through initial phone screens, and got to practice technical interviews (which were the scariest part for me). </p><p>And ultimately, I got to practice interviewing with those companies where I aspired to work. This prepared me for eventual success. </p><p>Instead of testing my resume with online tools, I got the real experience. I also crafted thank you letters when I didn’t get the job and sent them to the interviewers that took the time to train me for success. </p><p>Most importantly (and very fortunately), I didn’t have strict time constraints to find a job quickly so I didn’t have to accept any offer that came my way. I had the choice to choose what was best for me. I had been working as a freelancer since 2018 and I was always preparing to hit the jackpot.</p><h2 id=\"my-journey-to-accenture\">My Journey to Accenture</h2><p>I found out about a position at Accenture from AlbanyCanCode last year when I took a course at SUNY. </p><p>AlbanyCanCode was always by my side, helping me get clients when I started remote freelancing work as a Web Developer and Designer. I learned about the position right after our graduation last year, but after a few rounds of interviewing with Accenture unfortunately I didn’t make it. </p><p>This year, as usual, AlbanyCanCode continued forwarding me opportunities that were available. Well, I followed through, went through the interview process again, and here I am.</p><h3 id=\"the-accenture-interview-process\">The Accenture interview process</h3><p>The Accenture interview process, as you might suspect, was a very long one. It's typical for large companies to take around 2-3 months to interview and find the right candidate. </p><p>You start with two HR interviews and tips to prepare for the technical interviews. The HR Managers and Recruiters are your biggest allies – and you should ask as many questions as you can so they can help you succeed. </p><p>Of course, you have to put in a ton of effort to get the role. For me, the Technical interviews were always the scariest part, and I used freeCodeCamp, Practicum, Hacker Rank, or Code Wars to prepare for the Algorithms and Data Structures parts. </p><p>Aside from actual interview prep, work on your portfolio projects and make sure you're active on GitHub. The technical interviewers are going to look for those things, and you will get questions about them. </p><p>One of the technical interviews will be focused on your coding and analytical thinking skills, and the other will be more centered on your problem-solving and soft skills.</p><h3 id=\"life-at-accenture-after-i-got-the-job\">Life at Accenture after I got the job</h3><p>So I got the job! And I recently joined Accenture as a Software Engineer. At the moment we are in training, and we started with Orientation in mid-September. </p><p>The second week we worked in teams on projects, learning the Accenture method of working and bringing value to clients. </p><p>After that, we started training on the project we are assigned to work on. Because Accenture works with clients such as Fortune 100 companies, Government agencies, and other high-profile clients, I can’t give you many details about my role. But I can give an idea of what is on my plate. </p><p>I will be working on a financial project for a 401K/retirement plan product, and I will be on the design team. Perhaps by the time I actually finish training and join my team I will be reassigned to a new project, who knows? </p><p>This is what I know I can expect at any moment while working with Accenture. I will not be bored, that’s for sure. Again, I just need to be able to embrace change and adapt quickly.</p><h3 id=\"how-and-why-i-got-the-job\">How and why I got the job</h3><p>I think that the strongest contributing factor to getting hired was my persistence preparing every day to deliver the best I could offer. It was not easy, and it took a lot of time and effort to do that much preparation constantly. </p><p>Also helpful was my ability to communicate even though I have gaps in my English. My problem solving skills and my determination are certainly some of my most valuable skills. Being able to ask questions to get clarification was very helpful.</p><p>And being able to think outside the box, seeing things differently and from every perspective, definitely gave me an advantage. </p><p>Finally, my experience living in different countries allowed me to see and learn things that otherwise I would not have been able to do if I had lived in the same place all my life.</p><p>The fact that I believed in myself, I worked hard to skill up, and that I stayed motivated and persisted all paid off in the end.</p><h2 id=\"the-benefits-of-working-remotely\">The Benefits of Working Remotely</h2><p>Even though I moved a lot and worked around the world, I reached a point in my life that remote work was a must to get more exposure.</p><p>I am married to an artist that uses aluminum for his creations. He needs big machinery to transform the aluminum in art. We had already moved once a few years ago for one of my previous jobs, and it was pretty tough to move those heavy tools. </p><p>Although I got an interview with Google in 2018 for a UX/UI position it required me to move to NYC – which was impossible. </p><p>But I also like my small town. I lived in Rome for 7 years, a real metropolis (which is pretty much like NYC as far as traffic and chaos goes). And now I find that I rather prefer and really enjoy my quiet life in New York state.</p><p>But what about going into the office? Well, I worked on premises and I liked the experience overall. I learned a lot from being around people, and I was able to ask questions and get my answers right away. And it would certainly be more difficult to create such an environment remotely.</p><p>On the other hand, working remotely as a freelancer and now for Accenture makes me more productive. I get to use the time I was spending driving to work or chatting with people around the company in a more productive way. </p><p>I also get the chance to disconnect from everything when I need it and just focus on my current project. </p><p>Luckily, this is easy in an environment like the one Accenture cultivates that is based on networking with more than half a million employees from around the world. If you need help with something you can just post a question on internal portals. You'll find so many of your colleagues willing to help you, answering your questions as soon as they can.</p><p>Being able to work in my own environment not only makes me more productive but at the same time even more creative. Seeing the sun, the rain or the snow from my window without having to go outside when the weather is bad doesn’t have a price. I can also choose to work from my terrace in the backyard and enjoy the beautiful weather.</p><p>And by working remotely I get to spend more time with my husband and our pets. I get to continue to skill up by using Accenture's training programs and technical books available on the Business English and on the Cloud.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-s-next\">So What's Next?</h2><p>My professional focus for next year will be on growing with my team and delivering valuable contributions to the projects I’m working on. </p><p>At Accenture there are a lot of opportunities for professional growth, and that is what I’m looking for. I’m working on my skills and looking forward to new adventures – but first I have to deliver trust, value, and credibility, and create roots in the company. Then I'll just start to grow, like a tree.</p><p>I can tell that this has been a big change in my life – and it was my dream come true. I’m really excited about what the future holds. </p><p>At the same time there is a lot of learning I still have to do, and I have to live by the day and go one step at the time. My English is still in progress and I have to overcome my language gaps sometimes. Luckily working around people from all over the world makes it easier for me to learn and gain confidence.</p><p>Living my dream is a great motivator to keep getting better. I worked hard and sacrificed a lot to get here, and now I have to put in even more effort to keep going. </p><p>Happiness is not just reaching our goals but the journey to reach those goals. Getting the job I love makes me feel that it is not a job – it is my passion.</p><p>I am a dreamer, and that makes me want to grow in my career, get better at what I’m doing, and move forward. I like challenges and am looking forward to many more of them. I’m looking to grow every day and become a better version of me. This is just the beginning of a great story in my life!</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

scenes</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Becoming Women Techmakers Ambassador</strong></strong></p><p>In 2018 I decided to start my remote freelance career and to continue to expand my Full Stack Developer knowledge by finishing the last FreeCodeamp projects for the certification and taking AlbanyCanCode bootcamp.</p><p>I started frequenting Meetups and got a great relationship with Google Developer Group of Capital Region where I fall in love with Flutter, Google’s mobile app SDK for building beautiful native iOS and Android apps from a single codebase. In February 2019 I was nominated Google Developer Group Lead/Co-Organizer and Women Techmakers Ambassador for Capital Region and started to involve more women in GDG coding events and meetups. I started to lead a monthly GDG Meetup on Flutter with hands-on Codelab and at my first North America Women Techmakers online meeting, I learned of Google supporting us to promote International Women’s Day celebration events in March and April.</p><p><strong><strong>International Women’s Day event preparations</strong></strong></p><p>Since was the last day of February I couldn’t possibly put up an event on March 8th when the event is marked on the calendar. I started to work out details with Jason Rotella our GDG Lead founder that has extensive experience in organizing events. We were thinking of a small event with 2–3 speakers, 20 attendees and a 3-hour event open to women and men. Jason started to send emails to our past sponsors and speakers and to introduce me to them.</p><p>This was the beginning of a wonderful adventure that ended up being a very successful event. Everyone answered back and wanted to be part of the event. Soon we found us in a very difficult situation of having to decline offers for the venue because we already agreed on it. For the speakers, we decided to welcome all 8 women speakers that accepted our invitation even though we were aware that 3 hours were not enough and keeping in mind for next year to make an all day long event. It was a big surprise to find out that our community came all together to create an impact in IWD celebration event.</p><p>We started to work and coordinate every little detail to make sure that the 3 hours event will be a memorable one. Our sponsor Troy Web Consulting went above and beyond and exceeded not only our requests but our expectations also. They surprised me even with the minimal details of the event like flowers on the conference room and a beautiful drawing dedicated to IWD that was welcoming our guests at the registration point and many many other things that caught my eye every second and made me smile. They also took care of the event pictures having someone dedicated to it and facilitated the research for audio and video services. Being 1 hour and a half drive away back and forth for me the fact that the venue took care of refreshments was a big lifting up pressure from my shoulders.</p><p>In no time it turned out to be a full-time job to prepare the event but it was worth it. We started to have meetings with the venue representatives and speakers to prepare everyone for what to expect from the event and how to prepare for. We discuss the focus of the event on the topics like #BalanceforBetter and ‘We are Better Together’ (#BetterTogether).</p><p>Tacking a bootcamp class at AlbanyCanCode I got the help to spread the word for the event and have almost 12–14 women and few men from the Front End class joining the event. At a certain point, we had to put a cap on the RSVP in Meetup and block the attendance and got to discuss with the venue representatives about the room capacity and eventual possibility to extend it to accommodate more people because of the high request received. We were able to work out with them a solution to have additional chairs from the initial 20–30 to 40–50 room capacity and re-opened the Meetup RSVP. Even this way in the day of the event we acknowledged that there were other people trying to register for the event but ran out of the room and they showed up anyways. The public was diverse and almost 40 out of 55 in the room where women in tech and not or interested to switch to the tech industry.</p><p><strong><strong>The Big Day — </strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/events/259908829/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><strong>International Women’s Day event</strong></strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*8FTK_etu2dDa2h8wbvhZtA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*8FTK_etu2dDa2h8wbvhZtA\" width=\"624\" height=\"379\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--figure-strong\" style=\"font-weight: 700;\">International Women’s Day&nbsp;2019</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Even preparing everything in minimal details still brings you surprises and challenges to face and solve. Luckily I showed up 1 hour prior to the event and I was able to fix some technical issues as they arise and start on time. Not only, but our speakers also respected the time scheduled and we didn’t have to worry for running out of time and rush things in the end. For who attended until the end and I can tell that the conference room was full until the end of the event we had a raffle time with some Google prizes like Google mini and Google VR.</p><p>Here you can find some <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/photos/29920636\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">photos of the event</a> and the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zzyruEj_5Ak\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">videos of the event</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*JT27xYuRDrKZUx48pyzwNA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*JT27xYuRDrKZUx48pyzwNA\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--figure-strong\" style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Amanda Krik</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Our first lightning talk speaker was <strong><strong>Amanda Krik</strong></strong> — Game Designer, Educator and life long fan of games Amanda has been designing games for a variety of audiences for over ten years. She currently serves as the coordinator of RPI’s digital game hub by day, working with the local industry and schools to improve game development in the region. In her off time, she works on her own personal projects, does freelancing and has presented on a wide variety of game development topics including inclusivity in game development, open source game development, project management and game design.</p><p>Amanda talked about the gender balance in the game industry and issues with Confidence such as Imposter Syndrome vs reality. She explained the challenges of learning new skills and discomfort in asking for advise/help, the false expectations of task length and difficulty or even the fear of failure and how to overcome them as in the game cycle often happens by Playing — Failing and Having fun. Amanda prepared and Simple Game demo called Ren’Py but we suggested no live coding to avoid issues since the time was very short. She was able to present the demo with slides and explain the proceeds of a 15 min coding game walking through the steps the audience and show that everyone can code and join the game industry. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/masma9SO7tE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><strong>Video</strong></strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*08lP_G0zfOlf7QhhPWA-FQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*08lP_G0zfOlf7QhhPWA-FQ\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--figure-strong\" style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Stacey Gammon</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Our next speaker was <strong><strong>Stacey Gammon — </strong></strong>She’s worked at the National Security Agency, Google and most recently is Tech lead and Principal Software Engineer at Elastic. Stacey, like Amanda, talked about the Confidence &amp; Imposter Syndrome in the tech industry. She explained how to deal with it before, during and after getting a job. Her motto is “Reach for opportunities and believe in yourself!” With personal examples, Stacey explained the impact of giving yourself more credit can bring you more opportunities.</p><p>She also explained how Interviewing is subjective and Confidence, or doubt, can make a positive or negative impression on the interviewer and change the chances of getting the job. Not only, after getting the job, the Confidence has an impact on your success and growth at work and her message was that if you don’t understand something, don’t assume it’s a reflection of your own lack of knowledge but just speak up to have more opinions.</p><p>Stacey explained how Confidence, especially in a leadership position, can sometimes be construed as being too direct, or aggressive and she suggested to listen to feedback, adjust, learn, grow. Everyone will make mistakes including you and there will be situations with no easy answer, but continuing to have confidence and belief in yourself is integral for continued success in your career. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/B2ZI8f4zCVU\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><strong>Video</strong></strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*-0hN6p5GZqfmb2verDjkwg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*-0hN6p5GZqfmb2verDjkwg\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--figure-strong\" style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Jennifer Sertl</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Our lightening talks continued with the next speaker <strong><strong>Jennifer Sertl</strong></strong> — President and founder of Agility3R, a leadership development company dedicated to strengthening strategic skills and helping leaders become more resilient, responsive, and reflective.

Her formal education is in Marketing and Advertising from the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign. Sam has worked in marketing roles for industries such as steel, healthcare, Fintech (Financial technology), and digital media. <br> Currently, she is an entrepreneur and working on her first startup which is a mobile app called Qwigle.</p><p><strong><strong>Natalie Wysocki</strong></strong> — Natalie studied Information Science at the University of Michigan and has been working at Troy Web Consulting for almost 2 years as an Interaction Designer. She loves her work because it combines art, technology, and people. While she is still early into her career, she aspires to grow as a leader and as a technically skilled designer.</p><p>The panel discussion moderated by Blain Smith, Google Developer Group Lead and Co-Organizer for Capital Region, was focused on questions on diversity in the workplace and advocacy techniques adopted by the organizations.</p><p>Susan discussed the role of women in the workforce and the request to hire women by the tech industry. Natalie explained the role of diversity in her organization and the success her organization has found in developing a diverse, inclusive culture. She also related her role as a designer to embracing diversity because the job requires empathizing with clients and users, as well as bridging the gaps between stakeholders and teammates across multiple disciplines.</p><p>Shimantika explained her vision of diversity that goes beyond gender diversity and touches the cultural diversity. The diversity of the multidisciplinary teams that have the ability to create different products because of the different perspective that comes out from involving people with different professional backgrounds.</p><p>Natalie elaborated on the idea of people’s backgrounds by discussing how she aims to support her colleagues. Some may be shy, while others are more comfortable with being bold. As such, she describes the importance of empathizing with others and helping them in ways that suit their character. She advocates for listening and paying attention to the dynamics of the team.</p><p>Susan brought to the table the diversity between women and men and the focus on treating others how you like to be treated to bring balance in the diversity field general.</p><p>Shimantika stressed out the idea that if you believe in the idea you want to pursue to kill all the other solution and go for yours.</p><p>Susan mentioned the mentors' contribution to our paths empowering the decisions taken along the way. She brought awareness on women are not being good mentors for other women and the inability to thank for the compliments.</p><p>Natalie shared her experience at her organization as one that makes leadership opportunities highly accessible. She describes how easy it is for someone with an idea and an ambition to meet with the CEO and lead initiatives for change.</p><p>The public also shared their own experiences related to diversity and their own struggles and how they overcome them. Once again the public penalized women leadership because of inability to mentor other women bringing to the table the competition between women and how to overcome to it by being a supporter of other women is very hard for any competitive concept to survive.</p><p>Advocacy for diversity was promoted in the discussion by our speakers bringing to the table their own vision. Giving an opportunity for people to play fair and get to everyone the opportunity to lead. Because there are shy people that might think that their idea might not be good enough. Encouraging them to pursue their idea and support them to voice their ideas. Also, it was mentioned what steps we should take to make advocacy more effective in the professional world and not only. Creating more room for women in the tech industry does not mean only the developer fields but also the design and any other technical fields. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K7yxCnpk_6I\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><strong>Video</strong></strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*WJ8vAaqnkADYsS1XSYZVlw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*WJ8vAaqnkADYsS1XSYZVlw\" width=\"187\" height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*_jG2xUe0Nfr15i6ZUNobag.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*_jG2xUe0Nfr15i6ZUNobag\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><strong><strong>Annmarie Lanesey</strong></strong> — In 2008, Annmarie co-founded Greane Tree Technology, a New York State Certified Women Owned Business Enterprise (WBE). <br> In 2016, Annmarie founded AlbanyCanCode, an organization dedicated to helping talented local people from all backgrounds find pathways to employment in the regional technology sector. She serves on the boards of AlbanyCanCode, WMHT and the Capital Region Chamber.</p><p><strong><strong>Miriam Dushane</strong></strong> — Managing Partner of Alaant Workforce Solutions, which is recognized as one of the nation’s leading firms in helping employers attract, acquire, engage and retain the best talent.</p><p>Annmarie and Miriam talk in synchrony about AlbanyCanCode and the changing lives toward the tech industry. They explained how computer literacy nowadays affects more the women and other unrepresented categories and how the AlbanyCanCode program is making an impact on it by changing the balance in the Capital Region.</p><p>Their passion on talking about the Coding bootcamp for our community opened the door to many opportunities for all of us to get involved like the Laptop Landing Library program to enable the students to pursue the learning paths offered by the program. The availability of services like transportation or children care are very important in order to make the class available to everyone.</p><p>The discussion explained the involvement of the companies in the hiring process of the new graduates from the program. The actual tendency from organizations of accepting the grads from coding bootcamps without a Graduate Degree makes the AlbanyCanCode have a great impact in our community by offering all the hidden talent available out there. The fact is that the schools don’t teach and prepare the students for the new job industry.</p><p>Albany Can Code is the pipeline from K-12 to entry-level to mid-career. To solve for diversity in the software workforce, and to nurture code literacy across our entire region, the key is: empowering elementary and middle school teachers to include coding activities in the curricular day.</p><p>Albany Can Code has partnered with districts in the Capital Region, reaching more than one hundred K-12 educators in 2017. In two years AlbanyCanCode graduated 103 students (doubling every year) and about half have found jobs in IT. Many have gone on to complete additional courses with the Coding Bootcamp. The skills taught are the coding skills in the Front End, Back End, Databases, Automated testing classes, the soft skills like communications, teamwork, mindset, habits, and job ready with the project experience, resumes, interviews, and networking.</p><p>The employer network is one of the biggest assets of the AlbanyCanCode, having over 100 employers in the network, and almost 20 are engaged in the classes. They participate in mentorships with in-class visits, stories, resume help, mock-interviews. Also, they bring to the table the technologies: what’s new, what’s old, what do you need.

bootcamp. I wanted on that would allow me to keep my full-time job at the time as a Web Developer and Designer, but at the same time help me bring my skills as a Full Stack Developer up to date.</p><h3 id=\"diving-into-the-tech-community\">Diving into the tech community</h3><p>After a lot of research, I found <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">freeCodeCamp</a>, an online coding program, and I started to work on the Curriculum and projects for the Certifications.</p><p>This exciting adventure helped me, in 2018, make the decision to start my remote freelance career and dedicate more time to completing the projects for the last certifications on freeCodeCamp.</p><p>I started to attend local Meetups to meet other developers and share the same passion for coding. But there was something more that I wanted to peruse: a Hackathon. When FreeCodeCamp announced the <a href=\"https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">online Hackathon</a> in 2018, I just jumped in. Although that was my first experience and my team didn’t win any prizes, I decided to find other Hackathons in my area to repeat the experience.</p><p>Hackathons give you that kind of energy that you can’t explain to others. You get to work for 24 hours with a team you met a few minutes before and get to create wonderful projects.</p><p>When I found that there was <a href=\"https://hackupstate.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Hack Upstate XIII</a> organized in my area, I didn’t think twice and I signed up right away. I waited impatiently every day for the big day to come.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/7zzUxVDazGxUW5y5iMd0HTGL-pjgMxLpIHA5\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"7zzUxVDazGxUW5y5iMd0HTGL-pjgMxLpIHA5\" width=\"800\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Hack Upstate XIII (Source: Jesse Peplinski, 2019)</figcaption></figure><p>In the meantime, the more you look around the more you see stuff you never saw before. I discovered <a href=\"https://albanycancode.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Albany Can Code</a>, a local coding bootcamp that has Front End and Back End Developer classes. I joined to fulfill my dream to go back to college at least in a different sort of way.</p><p>I remember that everything happened so fast in my life that in no time I was doing everything I loved. I had a remote career that allowed me to work my own hours and study to get my certifications. I got the chance to work with a team of classmates in projects using Scrum as an Agile environment. The first projects for graduation were individual projects but the last projects were team projects.</p><p>During the class, we went from React Hooks — a hot topic — to React Native just a few weeks before the Hackathon. We worked on a few small projects, nothing fancy. Our instructors introduced us to Expo.io and the particulars of React Native that differentiate it from React.</p><p>Time was going by so fast, and I got involved more and more in coding meetups. One situation brings another one, and I was asked to teach Flutter at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Developer Group of Capital Region</a>. Shortly after I got nominated as a Women Techmakers Ambassador for the same chapter (Capital Region).</p><p>In the meantime, my freelance business started to grow. I was working on a few projects that gave me time to attend my coding bootcamp and organize the Google Developer Group CodeLabs and StudyJams though the Meetup Group.</p><p>I started to find myself so busy in all kind of activities that I found it difficult to take in more.</p><h3 id=\"the-hackathon\">The Hackathon</h3><p>The day before my Hackathon I just had time to pack some stuff I needed for the 48 hours I would be away from home. My husband supported every single decision of mine and made it easier on me to be part of all this craziness.</p><p>I arrived at the Hackathon and I had to find a team to join. I hoped to find a project that I could contribute to.</p><h4 id=\"finding-a-team\">Finding a team</h4><p>I only knew one girl that I met few weeks before that was going to go to the Hackathon. I was hoping to make a team with her, but when we came in I couldn’t find her in the crowd. The opening ceremony started and I was getting nervous because I didn’t have a team yet and they were already presenting the projects.</p><p>I had few chances to find a team before the ceremony, when I heard someone saying that they needed a Graphic and Web Designer. So I introduced myself and suggested that we could form a team. I found out that they were companies looking for talent and they asked me to contact them after the competition. That was nice because I am always open to joining a remote team to work as a Full Stack Developer no matter if in the Front End or the Back-End.</p><p>Listening to all the great ideas the groups were putting on the table I was thinking that I might need to work alone on a project. I figured I’d better start to coming up with some ideas.</p><p>All of a sudden I heard one of the last groups presenting say that they were looking for a Designer, since they had all the other parts of the team already formed. I didn’t even hear very well what they were going to work on, and everyone started to walk away from the room to find a spot to start to code.</p><p>I ran after the two guys that presented their project and introduced myself and told them that I was a Designer and I could join their team. We agreed and we headed to the office area to find a spot for us. We started all to talk about the project we would develop and which of the API’s in the competition we would use.</p><h4 id=\"the-tech\">The tech</h4><p>I was really hoping to work on a React project since I had some experience with projects I worked on for freeCodeCamp and the Albany Can Code bootcamp. I got hit by a hammer when I heard we would be working on a React Native project — but no one knew React Native. Some guys knew React like I did, and they decided to take care of the Front End functionality that I was hoping to work on. Some other guys knew Python and they were taking care of the Back End using Heroku and a Raspberry Pi to host the server and connect it to the API.</p><p>We were going to build an app called <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/parking-assistant\" rel=\"noopener\">Parking Assistant</a> that makes parking easier for drivers in the city by solving two types of problems: 1) managing long-term street parking and 2) addressing crime risks in the immediate area of the parking location.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/BTnMbhWr83nh-5UCV788fL-qI97lD7G9-Tor\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"BTnMbhWr83nh-5UCV788fL-qI97lD7G9-Tor\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Demo of “Parking Assistant” that help you know where it’s safe to park your car. (Source: STAE, 2019)</figcaption></figure><h4 id=\"learning-on-the-fly\">Learning on the fly</h4><p>I felt like I couldn’t breathe when I found out that I was supposed to take care of the React Native part. I didn’t know what to say. I proposed to the team that we use Expo.io to <a href=\"https://snack.expo.io/@lindakovacs/Z2l0aH\" rel=\"noopener\">test our mobile app</a> since I had some experience with it.</p><p>A few minutes later I was in front of a whiteboard making sketches of an app that I didn’t have any idea how to build. My team was making plans on how to break the process down into steps and distribute the work to be done between us.</p><p>Inside me, I was getting very nervous and found it difficult to concentrate. We finished making plans and deciding what everyone would do. We then started our own adventures and research. Somehow I didn’t pull myself out of this team and project — but I didn’t want to disappoint them and create a disaster.</p><p>The clock was ticking I was talking with the team asking questions and answering others to see how to coordinate our work. All the code I was writing was not working and I was not able to make much progress. I was reading the documentation because I knew that React Native is different than React. I was not using HTML and CSS for the Design part but had a different kind of approach that I needed first to get familiar with.</p><p>I got to build a very simple home page for our app with a title and a button and customize it. I made it answer the gestures using the React code that I was more familiar with. React Native was for sure a challenge and the 24 hours we had in our hands to build our app was not enough to get to know all the ins and outs of the language.</p><p>That was the first step and gave me more confidence in me. In class, we did some staff in React Native but nothing I needed for my app, so I was on my own.</p><p>Now I had to build a compass feature to use in the next component when clicking the button on the homepage. It was not easy, and even though it was getting late into the night we continued our work. After a while, I got to work the Compass and the complexity behind it. We integrated the code step by step one with another and moved over to the next step so we got to see progress and the app taking shape. I felt much better after completing this part of the mission.</p><p>Next on my list, I had to build a timer that would show to the user the time left until they needed to move their car to avoid a ticket. I found a library to use but it took me some time to figure out how to customize it. And even though I was following their instructions, it was not working the way I wanted it to work. At least I had the functionality we needed for the app, but I didn’t have too much time to play with it — we needed to add the component to the app so we could test the Compass and get the timer to work and get alerts as a result of using the API.</p><p>We started to test the app in the office by choosing points on the map near us and trying to point the compass the way it made sense to make the app work. But it didn’t work correctly.</p><p>We had to go out of the building on the street in the night to test the app. There were many things to overcome and work on after our testing. Other research and code debugging and so on. We were getting there and it was almost morning when all of us got some sleep in our sleeping bags on the floors all over the offices. Some people were from the area went home to sleep, lucky them! You couldn’t really sleep but just lying down and trying to close your eyes made you feel a little bit less exhausted. Our minds for sure would not shut off and would keep thinking of ideas to better our project.</p><p>After a while, all of our team got together and got to prepare a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-OHysS6lHcsdgoxTk0Zcj9GmqsSgghR1ygIP-rQp_lc/edit#slide=id.p1\" rel=\"noopener\">presentation</a>. We made some slides, a video demo, and so on.</p><p>The hosts and the sponsors got us food and drinks for the whole time to get us to concentrate on our mission to deliver innovative projects.</p><h4 id=\"how-our-hard-work-paid-off\">How our hard work paid off</h4><p>Everyone got ready to present the projects and we started to feel very good about our project and proud somehow. I was hoping in my heart to win at least a prize. The projects were one more innovative than the other, one more interesting than the other. It was not easy for the judges to decide and I got to like some of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FMUyMoDpvs&amp;t=3668s\" rel=\"noopener\">projects in the competition</a> myself. But I didn’t lose my focus. I came with the hope to build something but now I was confident and looking to win something.</p><p>The judges made their decision and silence came back in my mind and soul, my heart was beating slowly. All of the sudden I heard our app name: Parking Assistant won the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-xiii-the-results-are-in-28c801576637\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Use of Stae’s API</a> using a Syracuse Dataset prize. I was screaming inside my brain and threw my hands in the air and congratulated my team. As the list of prizes was getting smaller and smaller and nearer to the top and the Gran Prize, I heard again our app name. We won the First Runner-up prize! This time I started to scream from real from happiness.</p><p>It was not for the money, because we were a 7-person team — unusual for this kind of competition were the teams are between 2–5 or so people. The 2 prizes put together we had to divide between us, but we got to bring home $100 each. That was nice to have in our wallets, but the real joy was the fact that others appreciated our project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/FMYNs48VqLdvMoqVn-jrh22-m6330pWpMmDL\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"FMYNs48VqLdvMoqVn-jrh22-m6330pWpMmDL\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>The Parking Assistant hack team (Source: Jesse Peplinski, 2019)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"how-the-hackathon-changed-my-life\">How the Hackathon changed my life</h3><p>When I got home I started to share our success with relatives, friends, colleagues and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/hackupstate/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1711326969000330\" rel=\"noopener\">social networks</a>. The feeling was great, and I saw people start to react to my posts not only on Facebook but on LinkedIn and Twitter also, which are more professional networks.</p><p>I turned back to my normal life to organize what I started before the Hackathon: a monthly Flutter Meetup Study Jam. I also celebrated <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/photos/29920636/\" rel=\"noopener\">International Women’s Day’19</a> with a fantastic group of women speakers and a conference room full of almost 50 women and men.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/jxyI-M90c9dY37SaRVmgqF95VnrOospNmNln\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"jxyI-M90c9dY37SaRVmgqF95VnrOospNmNln\" width=\"800\" height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>International Women’s Day Celebration (IWD’19) — Women Techmakers and GDG Capital Region</figcaption></figure><p>A few days later after the Hackathon, we got contacted by the <a href=\"https://medium.com/city-as-a-service/hack-upstate-debrief-24837aa2f77a\" rel=\"noopener\">Stae API staff</a> to interview us about our experience working together on the project. It was nice to meet my team again, this time online. Everyone shared their experiences and future intentions related to our project.</p><p>The outcome of the Hackathon was that all of the sudden I got to talk with people more and I become more interested in the experience and my team winning a project at the Hackathon. Not to mention that I got to talk with businesses interested in working on great projects who wanted to get me involved.</p><p>I think all of us should consider participating at Hackathons online and in person. It gives you the opportunity to show the world the skills you’ve gained as a self-taught Developer, and your ability to work with a team that you just met to create fully functional and innovative products. Even for those that didn’t win a prize, they still created very interesting apps. We all interacted with them and had fun together, and we connected to work on new projects or open new startup businesses.</p><p>Also, before I finished writing this article for you, I got my invitation to the North America GDG Academy at the Google Boulder Office on July 12–13th.</p><p>Going out there to attend Meetups and organizing Codelabs and events dedicated to tech put me in contact with many businesses and developers in my community. All of this made my business grow, which would not have happened if I was sitting at my desk in my home office looking for new projects to work on. You get recommendations from people around you that you just met about new projects you can join. Things start to happen to you just by being in the right place at the right time.</p><p>So to all of you, I would like to say: get out there and change the world! Even if you think you can’t do it now, if you don’t try it you will never know the outcome. The whole world is waiting for your change and innovation!</p><p>Happy Hacking!</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;
