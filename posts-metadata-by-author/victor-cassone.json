and filled with uncertainty. There is no straight line from newbie to career programmer. Because of this, I believe all self-taught developers have a unique story to tell.</p><p>In this article, I’ll share my coding journey through a series of lessons I learned along the way. Hopefully reading about my experience teaching myself how to code will help you reflect on your own past, and motivate you to keep moving forward.</p><h2 id=\"lesson-1-focus-on-the-process\">Lesson #1: Focus on the Process</h2><p>When I first started learning to program, I never had the intention of making a career out of it. I just wanted to make a specific app.</p><p>My journey started when I was a senior in college. I just finished Richard Branson’s biography and I was probably reading too much TechCrunch. I was pumped full of entrepreneurial energy.</p><p>I was constantly reading about how college kids were receiving massive amounts of investment for their mobile app ideas. I thought I could be one of those college kids.</p><p>One day, while walking in between classes, an app idea hit me. I quickly became convinced that I’d found the next big thing.</p><p>I was consumed by the idea and stopped paying attention to lectures. My excitement for the app idea quickly grew to the point where I felt I needed to take action.</p><p>There was one big problem. My idea was a mobile app and I didn’t know anyone who could build mobile apps.</p><p>So I thought, \"what the hell, how hard could programming be?\" I was losing interest in my major and I was spending a lot of time playing Xbox. I could put some of my free time towards building out my mobile app idea.</p><p>Sometimes being naive helps you take action when you normally wouldn’t.</p><p>I was a college student with no programming, business, or design experience trying to learn Android so I could build a complex mobile app. I guess that’s what you get when you mix a big idea with the Silicon Valley hype machine.</p><p>I wish I could tell you things went well from here.</p><p>I bought a few books on Android development and spent countless hours in my room trying to duct-tape my app together. I didn’t care how the app worked, I just wanted a finished product.</p><p>Time went on and the app turned into a Frankenstein of copy and pasted code. The app didn’t have many features and it barely ran without crashing.</p><p>It wasn’t until I accidentally got into a Computer Science class that I realized that I should focus more on actually trying to learn software development.</p><p>My inability to program lead me to abandon my initial app idea. I'd come to the realization that I wasn’t going to make the next big thing, at least not yet.</p><p>Over time I corrected my behavior and took learning more seriously. I started to enjoy programming and eventually started a career as a software developer.</p><p>My big app idea consumed me for a long time. It put my focus on the end result rather than the process of getting there.</p><p>When you get too focused on the end result, you start taking shortcuts. Shortcuts might lead some short-term progress but in the long run, your lack of knowledge will always catch up to you.</p><p>It’s important to remember that learning anything big, like programming, requires many small steps. Each step will need to be treated with care.</p><p>Learning new things is like building a house. You start with the foundation and build up. If the foundation is faulty the whole thing will crumble down sooner or later.</p><p>Sometimes building a strong foundation requires you to slow down. There’s no shame in going slow. The people who understand the basics the first time will end up getting ahead of the people who have to go back and relearn them.</p><p>There’s an old Chinese proverb that goes:</p><blockquote>\"It is better to take many small steps in the right direction than to make a big leap forward only to stumble backward.\"</blockquote><p>It's not how fast you can do something, it's how slowly you can do it correctly.</p><p>I was a perfect example. From the outside, it might’ve looked like I was a programming whiz kid. In reality, I couldn’t build an app to save my life.</p><p>Focus on the process and you will surprise yourself with how much progress you make each day.</p><h2 id=\"lesson-2-stack-overflow-is-awesome-but-dangerous-\">Lesson #2: Stack Overflow is Awesome (But Dangerous)</h2><p>As I was building my killer app, Stack Overflow became my best friend.</p><p>Anytime I got stuck I would try to craft together a perfect question to ask the Stack Overflow community. I averaged a few questions a day.</p><p>Not only would I post questions, but I would also treat the answers on Stack Overflow as Gospel. I would spend a crazy amount of time scouring the site to try to find an exact chunk of code that would fix my problem.</p><p>When I found a suitable answer, I would copy and paste it right into my codebase and try to make it work with my existing code. I spent little time trying to understand the code I was adding.</p><p>I made brute-force trial and error a new art form.</p><p>This process went on for a while until eventually, I wised up and realized the flaws of my approach.</p><p>Stack Overflow is a blessing and a curse. It’s great at helping you solve problems – however, if you aren’t careful, you can quickly become dependent on the website.</p><p>Sometimes the website is too good at solving problems. It creates a false sense of confidence that can lead to more headaches down the road.</p><p>Stack Overflow shows you how to get something to work but it doesn't usually explicitly tell you why it works.</p><p>Understanding the how is important. Bugs need to be fixed and code needs to run.</p><p>However, understanding why something works is what's going to help you apply the knowledge again in the future.</p><p>It's like the quote...</p><blockquote>\"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\"</blockquote><p>Copy and pasting code from Stack Overflow is like giving someone a fish. Understanding why a snippet of code works is like teaching them to fish.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with copying and pasting code. We all do it. It's only a problem when it becomes a crutch and stunts our growth as a developer.</p><p>The thing I had to learn the hard way was that it's impossible to learn anything if the answers are constantly given to you. There are no short-cuts in the learning process.</p><p>When you're stuck, attempt to solve your coding problem at least a few times before going to Google.</p><p>When you find yourself copying and pasting code, spend a little time trying to understand the code snippet before moving on.</p><h2 id=\"lesson-3-learn-how-to-find-experienced-help\">Lesson #3: Learn How to Find Experienced Help</h2><p>The first thing I did after I decided I wanted to learn programming was buy two Android development books.</p><p>At the start, I followed the exercises in the books closely and worked through the example projects. However, I quickly got frustrated with the progress I was making following the book and decided to go off and figure out how to program on my own.</p><p>As you’ve read above, that slowly resulted in disaster.</p><p>I spent countless hours isolated in my room trying to figure out simple programming problems. I was getting stuck on every new line of code and it didn't feel like I was making much progress.</p><p>I was helplessly stuck and my life was a cocktail of doubt, frustration, and an overwhelming feeling of being lost.</p><p>To make matters worse, I had the bright idea to start using a massive C library called FFMPEG. My app needed to edit videos, so I thought it was a good idea to utilize the library’s robust functionality.</p><p>It wasn’t my smartest move, considering at the time, I could barely get my Android app working.</p><p>I wasted a lot of time trying to read the C code and figuring out how I could use it in my app. I struggled to even get the library imported into my Android project. The Android code and C code didn't want to play nice.</p><p>After many hours of getting nowhere, I eventually became frustrated and abandoned the library.</p><p>Around the same time as the FFMPEG debacle, I signed up for an Object Oriented Programming class. I'm honestly not sure how I got in. I later found out that I was the only non-Computer Science major in the class. I think there was a bug in the enrollment software.</p><p>The first assignment was to build a Blackjack program. I’d been teaching myself programming for 5-6 months at this point, and I felt somewhat confident with my skills.</p><p>I finished the assignment and felt good about my work.</p><p>It didn't take long for that feeling to fade.</p><p>My whole program was written in one huge method. Just about everyone else in the class was able to pick up on the fact that the program needed to be separated into classes.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>Luckily, the classwork and guidance from the teacher allowed me to take a step back from my Android app and reflect on my programming abilities. I started to value learning and reigned back my desires to make a completed app.</p><p>I've now come to realize that if I would've spoken to just <strong>one</strong> experienced developer in those early days, they would’ve seen what I was doing. I could have set my priorities straight, and talked some sense into me. They would’ve helped me correct my path when I was going down useless dead ends (like trying to work with FFMPEG).</p><p>Instead, I isolated myself from the world partially because I felt like there wasn’t anyone who could help me.</p><p>Isolation is a double-edged sword. On one side, it helps you focus on the task at hand. On the flip side, it removes you from the world, starving you of crucial feedback.</p><p>There were a lot of ways I could’ve found help. I could’ve tried to find a professor/student at the university with Android experience or looked to the local community for help. I also could’ve tried finding an online Android community.</p><p>Experienced developers are like a compass. They won’t get you to your destination but they will make sure you are pointed in the right direction. Their help can often be the difference between success and failure.</p><p>Make sure you seek out guidance wherever you can find it. It will save you time and frustration down the road.</p><h2 id=\"lesson-4-craft-your-environment\">Lesson #4: Craft Your Environment</h2><p>This might be the only thing I felt like I did right when I was teaching myself programming.</p><p>Throughout my life, I’ve been really bad at studying for tests or doing my homework at home. There are just too many distractions at any given moment. I would often try to find refuge in libraries or coffee shops.</p><p>Luckily I applied this rule when I was teaching myself programming.</p><p>I ended up becoming a regular at a few local coffee shops. I preferred coffee shops over other study locations because they provided some variety and it’s easy to hide (easy access to caffeine doesn’t hurt either).</p><p>If I was studying at home, I made sure my door was shut and my roommates knew not to disturb me for a certain period of time.</p><p>Regardless of where I was, I would make sure my music was loud enough so I couldn’t hear what was going on around me.</p><p>I can’t say I was perfect at finding a distraction-free work environment but I was able to succeed a majority of the time.</p><p>Having the right work environment is often an overlooked part of learning.</p><p>Focus is a foundational component of memory and skill acquisition. When you try to learn something new, the strength of the learning is directly linked to the intensity of your focus. When your focus is weak, new information will be less sticky which will result in slower learning and more time studying.</p><p>Your work environment should be distraction-free and should allow for long uninterrupted stretches of focus. Even with COVID-19 making it necessary to work remotely, there are still actions you can take to design your learning environment.</p><p>Here are a few things you can do:</p><ul><li>Find a location where people won’t interrupt you</li><li>Put your phone in airplane mode</li><li>Use some sort of timed website blocker for social media and news sites</li><li>Wear headphones and listen to non-distracting music (preferably a long playlist so you don’t have to constantly switch songs)</li><li>Avoid TV or other highly stimulating surroundings</li><li>Have a notebook nearby to write down any tasks or ideas that pop into your head</li><li>Make it known to the people around you that you don't want to be disturbed</li></ul><p>Only you can decide where and how to craft your environment. But make sure you do, because it’s worth it.</p><h2 id=\"lesson-5-get-out-into-the-world-and-meet-people\">Lesson #5: Get Out Into the World and Meet People</h2><p>Landing my first programming job was sort of a random occurrence.</p><p>I just moved to Omaha, Nebraska and I had around a year of self-taught development under my belt.</p><p>I knew very few people in Omaha, so I searched <a href=\"http://Meetup.com\">Meetup.com</a> to try and find other people interested in Android development. I found a Meetup focused on mobile development which covered both iOS and Android development and I decided to go.</p><p>Going to that first meeting was nerve-racking. I spent around 10 minutes in my car at the venue deciding if I should go in or drive off.</p><p>I was intimidated. I wasn’t confident of my programming skills and I knew everyone at the Meetup had much more experience than I did.</p><p>I finally said, screw it and went inside.</p><p>I’m glad I did.</p><p>I started to attend regularly and during one Meetup, not too long after I moved to Omaha, I met a recruiter who was looking for an Android contractor. We talked for a while and I got an interview for the job later that week.</p><p>Before the interview, I felt confident. During the interview, I was a deer in the headlights.</p><p>The interviewer was talking about the project I’d be working on and it all went right over my head. I tried to stay engaged but they could tell it was out of my range.</p><p>After the interview, they asked me to hang-out for an hour so I could talk to someone else. Knowing I blew it, I walked around downtown trying to clear my head.</p><p>I ended up interviewing with someone else at the company, and shortly after, they offered me an internship.</p><p>I was so shocked that after I signed all the paperwork and got my work laptop running, I went over to the CEO and asked if it was a paid internship or not.</p><p>The internship turned into a full-time job and I started my career as a software developer.</p><p>When you are self-taught, people are not going to come and seek you out. You will need to find opportunities for yourself.</p><p>Graduates of four-year universities and code schools have the advantage of leveraging their school's network when finding a job. Self-taught developers don’t have this luxury.</p><p>Self-taught developers will need to go out into the world and build their networks themselves.</p><p>Cold calling employers and sending out resumes can work. However, I've found people like hiring people who are close to them in their social network.</p><p>Websites like <a href=\"http://Meetup.com\">Meetup.com</a> are great for finding monthly programming-specific groups. Even in a pandemic, there are still many virtual Meetups that are very informative and beneficial.</p><p>There are also other Slack channels or Discord communities that you can leverage to make meaningful relationships. You can also try reaching out to various people in your area and ask to have a quick 15-minute virtual coffee with them.</p><p>Do what you can to build up the nerve to reach out and talk with people. Be friendly and talk to them about your experiences. Make sure people know of your long-term goal of finding a job.</p><p>Put yourself in situations where something positive might happen. You can’t win a raffle if you never buy a ticket.</p><p>Consider any opportunity that comes your way, because even if it looks like a dead-end, it has the potential to lead to something bigger.</p><p>My internship was a huge pay-cut to the other offers I had at the time. However, I knew if I worked hard it would be an opportunity for me to break into the tech industry.</p><p>The key is to think of job opportunities in the long-term. Internships or part-time jobs might not give you your desired salary upfront but they might open up doors in the future.</p><h2 id=\"i-hope-you-learn-from-my-mistakes-and-make-exciting-new-mistakes-of-your-own\">I Hope You Learn From My Mistakes and Make Exciting New Mistakes of Your Own</h2><p>As you can see, I made a lot of mistakes in my journey of becoming a self-taught developer.</p><p>Teaching yourself to code is never a straight road. All our stories are unique.</p><p>The key is to keep going and to avoid getting discouraged when things aren't going your way.</p><p>I encourage other self-taught developers to share their stories. Not only will they provide valuable insights, but they will also help shine a light on the unique paths we’ve taken.</p><p>Hopefully, my story and the lessons I learned will help you moving forward.</p><p>Thanks for reading.

   \n<p>I truly believe anyone can learn to code.</p><p>At the end of the day programming is a skill, and acquiring a skill is open to anyone.</p><p>Sometimes getting good at something appears to be a magical process. But in reality, there are clear steps to follow.</p><p>Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, is a leading researcher of expert performers. He studies the process of acquiring a skill and what it takes to become an expert.</p><p>Through his years of research, he concludes that what separates top performers from everyone else is the amount of time spent in something he calls Deliberate Practice.</p><p>He believes that “The right sort of practice over a sufficient period of time leads to improvement. Nothing else.”</p><p>I believe the Deliberate Practice framework developed by Dr. Ericsson can be used to help people learning to program.</p><p>Implementing Deliberate Practice has helped me in my personal life and I believe it can help you learn programming more efficiently.</p><p>Below I’ll explain each component of Deliberate Practice and how you can incorporate Deliberate Practice in your coding journey.</p><h2 id=\"deconstruction\">Deconstruction</h2><p>The first step of Deliberate Practice is to deconstruct and analyze your desired skill.</p><p>Deconstruction requires you to take a bird's eye view of your overall goal and break it down into small manageable components. You're trying to find the most efficient path from where you are to where you want to go.</p><p>There are two ways you can go about deconstructing a skill. You can either break down the components yourself or learn from someone who has already acquired the skill.</p><p>For someone learning to code, I'd recommend leveraging the knowledge of other developers instead of reinventing the wheel.</p><p>Most of the material out there (like freeCodeCamp) was created by people who have put effort into deconstructing the learning process and have iterated on the material.</p><p>You can leverage their expertise and effort when you're looking for your own path forward.</p><p>Flip through a few different coding websites or read the Table of Contents of various coding books (you can preview books on Amazon for free). Also, read a few blogs or ask a developer friend for their opinion.</p><p>After a while, you'll get a sense of the best path forward.</p><p>Also, make sure your interests have a vote. It's hard to learn quickly if you're not interested in the material.</p><p>The most efficient route to learning to code is at the intersection of what the experts recommend and what you're interested in.</p><p>Don't obsess about perfectly deconstructing the path to becoming a programmer. You'll never find the perfectly efficient route.</p><p>It's better to do a little research, start somewhere, and readjust as you go.</p><h2 id=\"stretch-goals\">Stretch goals</h2><p>The next key component of Deliberate Practice is creating stretch goals.</p><p>A stretch goal is a small task that pushes you outside your current abilities and moves you along your deconstructed learning path.</p><p>Creating stretch goals isn't so much about having a huge list of tasks you need to complete. The more important part is setting up your learning in a way that pushes the boundaries of your programming skills.</p><p>We humans naturally favor the things that are easy and automatic.</p><p>However, if we push ourselves outside our comfort zones for long enough, our body will try to normalize the new behavior and make it a habit.</p><p>The objective of a stretch goal is to consciously put yourself outside your comfort zone and wait for your body to adapt.</p><p>The trick to creating a stretch goal is making the task difficult but still achievable.</p><p>If the goal is too difficult, then you'll get lost and won't know how to move forward. If the goal is too easy then you won't develop as quickly as you could (or not at all).</p><p>It will take some time to find the sweet spot.</p><p>At the start, a stretch goal could simply be a lesson on freeCodeCamp. As time goes on, a stretch goal could be implementing a button on your portfolio website without using Google.</p><p>The key thing to remember is that if a task feels easy you're probably not pushing yourself enough.</p><h2 id=\"focus-and-attention\">Focus and attention</h2><p>Focus is a foundational component of memory and skill acquisition. </p><p>When you try to encode new information into your brain, the strength of the encoding is directly linked to the intensity of your focus.</p><p>When your focus is weak, new information will be less sticky which will result in slower learning and more time studying.</p><p>A common trait among people who learn programming quickly is they have the ability to intensely focus on whatever task they're performing for long periods of time.</p><p>Think about how any world-class performer practices. They're probably not checking their phone every 5 minutes. They're most likely mentally locked into whatever task they're performing.</p><p>Having good focus means eliminating all unwanted distractions.</p><p>There are two types of distractions, internal and external. Decreasing external distractions means shutting off your phone, going to a quiet room, and/or putting a site blocker on your computer.</p><p>Taming internal distractions means not letting internal thoughts consume your time. This can be done by practicing meditation or having a notebook to write down whatever is on your mind.</p><p>The key is to build a distraction-free environment and have a plan when a distraction inevitably pops up. You're probably already well aware of all the things that distract you.</p><p>(If you want more insights into where your time goes, I'd recommend using something like <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\">RescueTime</a>.)</p><p>Improving your focus is a process. In the beginning, try to be fully focused for a few minutes. As time goes on, slowly dial up the duration of your focused coding.</p><p>When deliberately practicing your programming skill, it’s better to be 100% focused for a shorter amount of time than 70% focused for a longer amount of time.</p><p>It's might feel impossible to maintain focus since we live in a world that's constantly trying to grab our attention. Nonetheless, you must find a way.</p><h2 id=\"perform\">Perform</h2><p>The only way to get better at something is by actually doing it.</p><p>People often confuse acquiring knowledge with acquiring a skill. Knowledge is useful but it isn’t a substitute for actually attempting something.</p><p>Knowledge, in many ways, gives you a false sense of progress. You can watch 100 coding tutorials and feel like you're capable of coding your own website. However, once you go out and try to build one for yourself, you could end up falling on your face.</p><p>It's like the difference between watching baseball and playing baseball. Watching helps you play but you can't become a good baseball player just by watching your favorite professional baseball team.</p><p>Acquiring skills requires you to go out into the world and test your knowledge against reality.</p><p>This isn't always easy. Practicing something new will attack your ego and make you feel incompetent. You'll want to quit or go back to something that feels more comfortable.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's impossible to learn something new without looking incompetent (at least at first). You might as well get used to it.</p><p>As we talked about above, learning doesn't happen inside your comfort zone. Don't be surprised if you start to feel uncomfortable as you code. Discomfort is usually a sign you're headed in the right direction.</p><p>Make sure you're constantly testing out your knowledge against the real world. Don't settle for reading tutorials or watching videos. Put your fingers to the keyboard and write some code that you can run.</p><h2 id=\"feedback\">Feedback</h2><p>It's impossible to get better at anything without feedback.</p><p>Imagine trying to improve your golf game but you are unable to see where the ball lands. There'd be no way to know if you're getting better.</p><p>Feedback is the way reality communicates with you. It allows you to see the gap between what you think you know and what you actually know.</p><p>There are two ways to get feedback. You can get it through self-study or someone else can provide it.</p><p>Self-study requires you to compare what you attempted with the correct solution someone else posted.</p><p>This naturally happens when you go to websites like Stack Overflow or GitHub to find an answer to a problem. The feedback happens when you discover the gap between your answer and the correct answer.</p><p>When you go to websites like Stack Overflow, make sure you spend time understanding why a chunk of code works and how it’s different. Copying and pasting without understanding the difference will rob you of important feedback that will help improve and update your skills.</p><p>You can also read through someone's code on Github and compare it to your own code (or compare it to your current understanding of how to code).</p><p>Ben Franklin used a similar strategy when he was improving his writing skills.</p><p>He would read an article from his favorite newspaper a couple of times. Then he would deconstruct the techniques the author used. He would put the article away and try to replicate it in a similar fashion. After he wrote his version, he would compare the results and analyze his execution.</p><p>The other way to get feedback is by letting a more experienced developer see and comment on your code.</p><p>Having a fresh pair of eyes can help you solve individual problems and also can help you get back on track if you’re heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>It might be scary having someone else look at your code (or even having a conversation with an experienced developer). None of us want to look dumb. If you can get over your fear, getting feedback from others can have a big impact.</p><p>One of my biggest regrets when I was teaching myself to code was that I didn't get enough feedback. My code was a mess and I was wasting a lot of time on unimportant things.</p><p>Getting feedback from a more experienced developer would have saved me a lot of time and struggle. They would’ve instantly seen what I was doing wrong and put me on a straighter path.</p><p>Think of feedback from an experienced developer as a compass. They won’t physically get you to your destination, but they will make sure you are going in the right direction.</p><h2 id=\"adjust\">Adjust</h2><p>Feedback is worthless if you don’t actually use it.</p><p>Learning to code is like moving through a dark room. You start walking, bump into some furniture, adjust your route, and try again.</p><p>Based on the feedback you receive, it’s important to take some time to think about the gap between what you wanted to do and what actually happened. Based on that gap, make adjustments as you move forward.</p><p>If you don't make adjustments, you won't improve.</p><p>You'll need to adjust specific lines to code to make your program work. You'll also sometimes need to adjust your approach at a macro level.</p><p>Our initial instinct when we aren’t making progress is to try harder. This is only effective to a point.</p><p>If you are not getting the results you want, try attacking things from different angles. It might take some experimentation to get it right.</p><h2 id=\"repeat\">Repeat</h2><p>Performing a task once isn’t enough.</p><p>Our minds don't store information like computers. We tend to forget new information just as quickly as we learn it.</p><p>Learning something new requires you to repeat a task multiple times before it sticks.</p><p>Repetition is a signal to our brains that a new piece of information or a new behavior is valuable and shouldn't be forgotten.</p><p>The repetition stage of acquiring skill is not easy. It’s not supposed to be. You are consciously trying to reprogram your brain and your body will naturally want to do what's familiar.</p><p>You will need to consistently apply effort towards learning to become proficient.</p><p>The only sure-fire way to fail at learning to code is quitting. If you don't quit and maintain consistency, you will be able to repeat the important coding material and everything will eventually start making sense.</p><p>No matter how tough it feels, make sure you develop a consistent study habit. It is nearly impossible to learn coding without one.</p><p>For a deep dive into how you can be more consistent, <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-be-more-consistent-when-learning-to-code/\">I wrote an article</a> about specifics techniques you can use.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>The process of acquiring skill is simple, but it’s not easy. You are your biggest enemy in the process.</p><p>Old habits are hard to break. Each new skill is its own battle to be won.</p><p>Stay focused, make sure you're pushing yourself, adjust based on the feedback, rinse, and repeat.</p><p>If you follow the Deliberate Practice framework, I believe you’ll surprise yourself with the speed that you pick up programming.</p><p>Best of luck.</p><p><strong>If you want to hear about other insights I've learned along the way,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zero2programmer\"> follow my account Zero to Programmer on Twitter</a>.

someone before they started learning to program, I’d teach them how to be consistent.</p><p>Successful self-taught developers don’t have any special abilities that others don’t possess.</p><p>What they do have are the habits, routines, and/or life circumstances that allow them to consistently apply effort towards their studies.</p><p>I believe the hardest part of teaching yourself programming isn’t the difficulty of the material but rather setting up your life in a way that allows you to consistently chip away at your goal.</p><p>Existing habits are hard to break. Expectations of the people around you are hard to manage. These factors are often overlooked.</p><p>The key difference between someone who has successfully taught themselves programming and someone who has failed is that one person stopped before the job was done and the other person didn’t. It’s that simple.</p><p>A slow learner who shows up consistently will always outperform a fast learner who quits early.</p><p>Regardless of who you are, learning to program is a large undertaking that requires a sizable commitment of time. Until we discover a way to upload memories into our brains, the only reliable way we can make it through this large pile of hours is through consistency.</p><p>Shortcuts and hacks don’t work. It’s not possible to become proficient at programming by drinking a case of Red Bull and studying for 3 days straight.</p><p>Just like eating an elephant, learning programming can only be done one bite at a time.</p><h2 id=\"tiny-habits\">Tiny Habits</h2><p>Tiny Habits is the best methodology I've found when it comes to changing your behavior and becoming more consistent.</p><p>Tiny Habits is a behavior change framework developed by Dr. BJ Fogg. BJ Fogg is the founder of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University and is largely considered one of the world’s leading experts in behavior and habit change.</p><p>In my opinion, Tiny Habits provides the best framework for behavior change. It’s backed by both research and real-world applications.</p><p>Through his years of research, BJ Fogg has found only 3 ways people change their behavior.</p><ol><li>Epiphanies</li><li>Environment changes</li><li>Taking baby steps</li></ol><p>Out of the three options, epiphanies are the most unreliable. People can’t usually create an epiphany on demand. If you can, well, you might have some sort of superpower.</p><p>Changing your environment is a good option if you can manage it. However, most self-taught developers I meet are trying to fit their studies into their already busy lives.</p><p>This leaves taking baby steps as the best option. Taking baby steps is available to everyone and it’s easy to apply to your life once you know the basics.</p><p>Tiny Habits is a framework centered around taking baby steps.</p><p>Tiny Habits have three main pieces.</p><ol><li>An anchor</li><li>A tiny behavior</li><li>A reward</li></ol><p>In the remainder of the article, I’ll explain the three parts of Tiny Habits and look at ways you can apply it to self-taught development.</p><h2 id=\"the-fogg-behavior-model\">The Fogg Behavior Model</h2><p>The core component of Tiny Habits is the Fogg Behavior Model. The Fogg Behavior Model is represented by the formula B = MAP.</p><p>Behavior = Motivation * Ability * Prompt</p><p><em><em>Motivation — </em></em>Hopes, fears, pleasure-seeking, pain avoidance, social acceptance, and social rejection.</p><p><em><em>Ability — </em></em>Your ability to perform a task, which includes: time, money, physical effort, mental effort, social deviance, and routine.</p><p><em><em>Prompt — </em></em>An internal or external trigger that reminds you to do the behavior.</p><p>The Fogg Behavior Model is represented visually by the graph below.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/BJ-Fogg-Behavior-Model-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"BJ-Fogg-Behavior-Model-1\" width=\"318\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>A behavior occurs when motivation, ability and a prompt converge at the same time. If these three variables converge above the Action Line then a behavior occurs. If not, then nothing happens.</p><p>As you can see, our motivation and ability work together to bring behaviors into existence. Hard to do behaviors require a high level of motivation and easy to do behaviors require a low level of motivation.</p><p>I like to think of the Fogg Behavior Model as a bit of code that runs in our brains.</p><p>The prompt triggers a code block that checks the variables ‘ability’ and ‘motivation’. If either variable is high/low enough then it returns a behavior. If not, then it returns nothing.</p><p>The Fogg Behavior Model is a simple but powerful discovery that can have a large impact on your approach to learning software development.</p><p>It will act as the foundation for developing Tiny Habits and should be referenced frequency.</p><h2 id=\"avoid-motivation\">Avoid motivation</h2><p>A habit can only be created when a behavior consistently stays above the Action Line. </p><p>There are only two ways this can occur.</p><ol><li>Maintain a high level of motivation.</li><li>Make a behavior easy to perform.</li></ol><p>Maintaining a high level of motivation over a long period of time is possible. As Neicheze said, “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.”</p><p>But I wouldn’t bank on it.</p><p>As I’m sure we’ve all experienced, our motivation comes and goes without warning. One day we're excited about a new project and the next we struggle to find the energy to get off the couch. </p><p>We're often tricked into feeling like the wave of motivation we're riding will last forever. But it never does.</p><p>Our external motivations lose their power or shift away. Our internal motivations slowly dwindle due to the constant assault from our fears and doubts. </p><p>We lose the fire we once had and we end up right back where we started.</p><p>We humans are complex and our motivations are inconsistent.</p><p>For these reasons, motivation is the most volatile variable in the Fogg Behavior Model.</p><p>James Clear, author and blogger, developed a fantastic graphic illustrating the effect of motivation on our habits.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/start-small--1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"start-small--1-\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Motivation should be thought of as a fair-weather friend. Its presence is nice but it shouldn’t be trusted with anything important.</p><p>The safe thing to do is to side-step motivation and design your study habit with the assumption that your motivation will always be low.</p><p>Staying under the ebbs and flows of motivation is the only reliable path to consistently repeating a behavior.</p><h2 id=\"identifying-a-tiny-behavior\">Identifying a tiny behavior</h2><p>A common mistake people make when developing a new habit is starting too big. We tend to think of behavior change as one big step rather than a series of smaller steps.</p><p>Big behaviors are attractive because they feel like the most efficient route. We tell ourselves something like, “If I study for 3 hours a day then I’ll learn programming in no time.”</p><p>However, big behavior changes are fragile because they rely on a high level of motivation. </p><p>Since motivation can't be trusted, easy to do behaviors are the best path towards consistency.</p><p>Unlike motivation, prompts and ability are almost completely in our control. We can choose a well-crafted prompt or decide on a behavior that’s within our ability.</p><p>A tiny behavior can be discovered by experimenting with the subcomponents of the Ability variable from the Fogg Behavior Model (time, money, physical effort, mental effort, social deviance, and routine).</p><p>Imagine each one of these subcomponents as a dial you can turn up and down. The key is to turn them as low as possible without changing the nature of the behavior.</p><p>For example, BJ Fogg recommends flossing one tooth to start a flossing habit. It’s hard to say no to flossing one tooth.</p><p>The tiny behavior for learning to code could be something as simple as logging into your computer and opening a browser.</p><p>As the illustration in the last section points out, it needs to be “so easy, you can’t say no.”</p><p>It might seem like a waste of time doing something so small.</p><p>Remember, what we’re after are long-term changes. Each tiny behavior acts as the foundation that future behaviors are built upon.</p><p>If you want to do more, go for it. Treat it as extra credit. Just make sure you never do less than the tiny behavior.</p><h2 id=\"setting-up-a-prompt\">Setting up a prompt</h2><p>Next, we need to identify a prompt that will act as an anchor for the new habit.</p><p>Prompts are simply a reminder to act. These can include notifications, people, remembering something or other habits (among other things).</p><p>Behaviors can’t exist without a prompt.</p><p>Spend some time making sure your prompt is worthwhile. The new habit will fall apart if the prompt isn’t well-established and well-anchored in your life.</p><p>I’ve found the best prompts are those that leverage existing habits. You can make the end of one habit the prompt for a new one. I’ve also found visual cues like sticky notes to be effective.</p><p>Use the following fill-in-the-blank sentence when trying to figure out your prompt. After I _____ I will ______.</p><p>For example, after I make my morning coffee I will sit down and open freeCodeCamp.</p><p>You will probably need to rework your prompt if you find yourself consistently forgetting to do your tiny behavior.</p><p>Moving from the prompt to your tiny behavior should feel natural. If it’s not, then either your prompt or tiny behavior needs to be reworked.</p><p>Finding a good anchoring prompt will require some experimentation.</p><h2 id=\"identifying-a-reward\">Identifying a reward</h2><p>The last thing you need to remember when developing your study habit is to reward yourself.</p><p>We are hardwired to repeat behaviors that provide us with positive feedback. It’s a signal to our brains that a behavior has value and is worth repeating.</p><p>Rewards need to be immediate and positive. If either of these two things is missing then the reward won’t be effective.</p><p>Avoid negativity if you fail. Positive reinforcement is the only way to grow new behaviors. Negative reinforcement can only shrink existing behaviors.</p><p>At a minimum, you need to reward yourself immediately after you complete your tiny behavior. For bonus points, you can also reward yourself when you remember your prompt and during the actual tiny behavior.</p><p>The easiest reward at your disposal is an instant celebration (out loud or quietly). Try telling yourself “Good job” or give a little fist pump. These small acts can go a long way.</p><p>Rewarding yourself after each tiny behavior might seem silly. However, rewards are a fundamental part of habit formation.</p><p>BJ Fogg points out that, more than anything else, emotions create habits. Rewards are the mechanism that injects positive emotions into the new behavior.</p><p>Setting up your prompt and tiny behavior only plant the seeds. Rewards provide the sunshine and water that allow a habit to grow.</p><p>You won’t need to reward yourself forever, just until the behavior becomes a habit.</p><h2 id=\"tiny-behavior-to-tiny-habit\">Tiny behavior to Tiny habit </h2><p>Once you have a solidly anchored prompt, a tiny behavior identified, and a reward setup, the only thing left to do is let time work its magic.</p><p>As time goes on, the new behavior will slowly move to the right on the Fogg Behavior Model.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/02/BJ-Fogg-Behavior-Model-1-color.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"BJ-Fogg-Behavior-Model-1-color\" width=\"318\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>As your programming ability increases and your new study habit becomes routine, increasing the time and intensity will feel natural.</p><p>The key is to only increase the time and intensity of your study habit when you feel comfortable doing so. Don’t force it.</p><p>Forcing the behavior will cause both your Motivation and Ability to decrease, which will slowly push you below the Action Line.</p><p>You are trying to build a solid foundation that future habits can be built upon. Moving too quickly can put that in jeopardy.</p><p>If you fail at any point, don’t look at it as a personal failure but rather a design failure. Your behavior either wasn’t small enough or your prompt wasn’t a solid anchor.</p><p>As I’ve mentioned, it’ll take some experimentation to get it right.</p><p>Life can be hectic sometimes so don’t get upset if you abandon your new Tiny Habit altogether. When the opportunity presents itself, reassess your prompt and tiny behavior and start fresh.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I truly believe anyone can learn to program if they are consistent.</p><p>Teaching yourself programming isn’t easy. Each day can be a grind. However, you don’t give yourself a chance if don't consistently show up.</p><p>I hope you've found Tiny Habits useful. I think it's an important tool when designing a consistent study habit.</p><p>You'll be surprised how easy and fun behavior change can be once you start small.</p><p>Big changes start from small beginnings.</p><p><strong>If you want to hear about other insights I've learned along the way, follow my alter ego <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zero2programmer\">Zero to Programmer on Twitter</a>.
