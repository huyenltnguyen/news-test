This is the story of how I encountered that problem, how I debugged it, and finally how I fixed it using AWS cloud.</p><h2 id=\"where-did-the-site-s-styles-go\">Where Did the Site's Styles Go?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-132.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-132\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-132.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/image-132.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/image-132.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-132.png 1906w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1906\" height=\"917\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>A broken site === A broken heart</figcaption></figure><p>I remember just changing the margin of a class in the site's CSS editor using a variable. When I clicked save on the styles editor in the admin site, I saw the live preview just blank out. I opened the live site in a new tab, and I was greeted with a broken website on all routes.</p><p>Weird...that simple change shouldn't have broken the site. Maybe their styles editor doesn't support variables? I deleted the CSS variable I created and used normal pixels. Site still broken. Console shows no error.</p><p>Fine! I removed all my custom CSS from the styles editor. Same problem. At this point I start panicking. How did I break the site? Why was the website refusing to load ANY styles?</p><p>Wait. I just asked the right question. Why wasn't the site <strong>loading</strong> my styles? I realized I didn't know if all my custom and Squarespace CSS were embedded into the HTML or if they were delivered over the network. </p><p>I inspected the HTML for any linked stylesheets, and found a suspect in the header called <em>site.css</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-133.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-133\" width=\"462\" height=\"52\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>An externally linked stylesheet</figcaption></figure><p>I confirmed the culprit when I switched to the Network tab to see if the request to this particular CSS file was successful.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-134.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-134\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-134.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-134.png 755w\" width=\"755\" height=\"261\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>It wasn't. It was returning a 5xx error. In the screenshot I manually blocked the request to replicate the issue so the status is different from the original, but the effect is the same: our site is requesting the main stylesheet from Squarespace and that request was failing which broke the site's styling.</p><p>Phew! I stopped panicking and regained my confidence. This wasn't my mistake, it was Squarespace's.</p><p>To confirm, I looked up and visited Squarespace's status page. Indeed, their status page indicated that they were experiencing some problems on their servers that, among other things, caused styles not to load for many users. Nothing more I could do. I just waited until the issue was resolved.</p><p>It took 15 <strong>minutes</strong> for Squarespace to fix the problem. I thought maybe this was a rare issue, and I got lucky it happened at a very late hour past midnight. I was so wrong...</p><h2 id=\"we-needed-a-solution\">We Needed a Solution</h2><p>A few days later, my client tried and failed to reach me to alert me that the site was, you guessed it, BROKEN. By the time we got in touch later that day, I found out that the same issue happened again. And it happened in the middle of the day for a longer period close to <strong>30 minutes.</strong></p><p>The client understandably freaked out and deleted all custom CSS (thankfully I had a local copy), and prayed for the best (while probably thinking I broke their website and vanished).</p><p>In hindsight, I should have communicated better and informed them of that problem when I first faced it. It wasn't Squarespace's mistake this time (although it totally was), it was mine for not coming up with a solution when I encountered it.</p><p>The problem here, as I saw it, was that our stylesheets were hosted on a server that wasn't under our control. How do I remove that external dependency from the website?</p><p>To answer that question I looked to the cloud...</p><h2 id=\"my-initial-aws-solution\">My Initial AWS Solution</h2><p>In my original development, I would put my custom CSS code in Squarespace's custom CSS editor. The site editor accepted SASS, so I wrote my styles in SASS, and always stored a copy on a local Git folder I have on my machine to have some sort of versioning.</p><p>As I mentioned before, the stylesheets are hosted on Squarespace's servers, so I needed my own hassle-free way to host these stylesheets. So I came up with the following solution.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-135.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-135\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-135.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-135.png 712w\" width=\"712\" height=\"544\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In this scenario, I, the website developer, would write my code on Squarespace's custom CSS editor, then copy/paste the SASS to my local machine. The following flow would then take place:</p><ul><li>I push my code to CodeCommit</li><li>The push event would trigger a Lambda function </li><li>The Lambda function would pull the latest SASS file, and convert it to a CSS stylesheet.</li><li>The Lambda function would store the CSS stylesheet in a publicly available S3 bucket</li><li>A custom inline script on the website would check if the expected stylesheet from Squarespace was loaded.

Here's how I tested it.</p><p>As I hinted at the beginning of the article, I can simulate a failed request to fetch our site's stylesheet from Squarespace by going to the browser's Network tab (making sure I disable the cache to avoid cached stylesheets), and then blocking the CSS request's URL:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-138.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-138\" width=\"586\" height=\"748\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>After clicking \"Block request URL\", and refreshing the page, we should see my script kicking in after 20 milliseconds.

And the site should work without breaking!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-140.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-140\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-140.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/image-140.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/image-140.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-140.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1920\" height=\"938\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"a-better-solution\">A Better Solution</h2><p>Honestly, I was kind of proud of this quick solution and seeing it work was a joy. It's a cheap and serverless option that's not too complicated.</p><p>But this solution <em>is</em> more complicated than it needs to be. And it's not without its caveats.</p><p>The downside of this solution is that the fallback style is still dependent on the website developer to keep the fallback styles that are in the CodeCommit repository up to date at all times. </p><p>Also, there are other site admin users (like the designers) who sometimes edit the site's custom styles themselves. So this solution relies on perfect communication between team members to let the developer with AWS access know of custom changes so they can update the repository.</p><p>As I was reading more about AWS services available for use, I came across an awesome service called <a href=\"https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html\">CloudWatch Events</a>. This service allows you to trigger workflows in your AWS account based on monitored metrics OR on a scheduled basis.</p><p>So I decided to use CloudWatch Events as a serverless cronjob that triggers a Lambda function that scrapes our website's stylesheet on a daily basis, and stores it in the S3 bucket.</p><p>The modified solution now looks like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-142.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-142\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-142.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/image-142.png 689w\" width=\"689\" height=\"727\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In this modified flow, we removed the dependency on the website developer to manually update the stylesheet and push to CodeCommit for the fallback styles to be created.</p><p>In this case, we have a daily scheduled CloudWatch Event that triggers a Lambda function.</p><p>Our Lambda function then scrapes our website for externally linked stylesheets, merges them into one fallback CSS file, and stores it in the publicly available S3 bucket. The website script stays the same as it checks for default stylesheets and requests it from our S3 bucket if not found.</p><h3 id=\"lambda-code\">Lambda Code</h3><p>Let's start with the new lambda function.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import sys, os\nimport urllib.request as req\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport logging\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import ClientError\n\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    fallback_css_filename = 'fallbackStyles.css'\n    fallback_css_path = '/tmp/' + fallback_css_filename\n    url = '&lt;https://www.mebbels.com&gt;'\n    \n    html = req.urlopen(url) # request the initial page\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser') \n    fallback_styles = open(fallback_css_path, 'ab')\n    \n    for link in soup.find_all('link', type='text/css'): # get links to external style sheets\n        address = link['href'] # the address of the stylesheet\n        if address.startswith('/'): # relative link\n            address = url + address\n        css_file_name, headers = req.urlretrieve(address) # make a request to download the stylesheet from the address, returns bytes\n        css = open(css_file_name, 'rb')\n        fallback_styles.write(css.read())\n        css.close()\n    \n    try:\n        s3_client.upload_file(\n            fallback_css_path,\n            'mebbels-assets',\n            fallback_css_filename,\n            ExtraArgs={\n                'ACL': 'public-read',\n                'ContentType': 'text/css'\n                }\n        )\n        return True\n    except ClientError as e:\n        logging.error(e)\n        return False\n</code></pre><p>In this lambda, I use the BeautifulSoup library to web scrape our website. I download every single externally linked stylesheet and wrote them to a file in the temporary folder (AWS Lambdas allows you to store files temporarily in a folder called 'tmp' during runtime).</p><p>After writing all the styles to a single fallbackStyles.css file, I uploaded that to our S3 bucket using the AWS SDK just like before.</p><p>But unlike before, I now backed up ANY externally linked stylesheet, so I could back up an externally linked Google fonts stylesheet or or Bootstrap CSS CDN, for example.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-use-scheduled-cloudwatch-events\">How to Use Scheduled CloudWatch Events</h2><p>This was a new service for me that I was very excited to try out in a practical use case like this.

My greatest fear was losing all my technical knowledge and learning momentum I had gained over the years which would set me back in my career.</p><p>This is the story of how I overcame that challenge, and ended up taking advantage of the situation and becoming a better programmer.</p><h2 id=\"surprise-time-to-enlist\">Surprise – Time to Enlist</h2><p>On a cold October evening in 2019, I remember receiving that fateful call from my local police station's military office. It was around 8 pm a few minutes after getting off a work call on Slack.</p><p><em>\"Is this Adham Mostafa El Banhawy?\"</em></p><p><em>\"Yes, who is this?\"</em></p><p><em>\"This is the army conscription office. You have been enlisted for military service. Show up at the police station tomorrow morning to complete the necessary paperwork.\"</em></p><p><em>\"Wh- is there anything I should bring with me?\"</em></p><p><em>\"Just your ID.\"</em></p><p><strong><em>*</em><strong><em>click</em></strong><em>*</em></strong></p><p>Following that call, I sat still at my desk for what seemed like forever. I'd been doing the conscription paperwork for almost a year, and every time there was a new class, my enrollment would be postponed. I had many factors that should've deemed me unfit for service, and people who were similar to me in the past were exempted before.</p><p>However, it wasn't the fact that I was enrolled that bothered me. I was prepared for that possibility mentally and physically. What <em>really</em> bothered me was the timing of that call. </p><p>As I sat silently at my desk, I remembered a heated debate I had had with my father the night before in that same room where I was now sitting. We were arguing, quite loudly, about the then dismal state of political affairs in our country. </p><p>I could not remember any specifics, but I did remember two worrisome facts. I remember criticizing the ruling regime, and I remember there was at least one open window in the room which was only about a meter a way from the street. That was extremely reckless of me.</p><p>Never mind. There was nothing I could do about it but comply. The day after was going to be the first day of a really long and treacherous journey I had to take. </p><p>I decided to get one last good night's sleep as a civilian.</p><h2 id=\"how-i-kept-a-level-head\">How I kept a level head</h2><p>My first month or so in the army I spent in a bootcamp. Even though it was a military base in the capitol city, it was an incredibly isolated and barren piece of land with strict anti-technology rules. </p><p>No phones or electronics of any kind were allowed. No books or notebooks. No personal belongings in general were allowed in. </p><p>I did sneak in a notebook and a pen, though. It may not seem like much, but they were actually very useful. I could write down important names, tasks, reminders, and sometimes try to solve issues that popped up using that information.</p><p>So in terms of maintaining a sharp mind amidst the lack of technology, I used a pen and paper to continue problem solving. Only this time I was solving problems of a social and military nature.</p><h2 id=\"seeking-out-a-screen\">Seeking Out a Screen</h2><p>Once I reached my main unit's base, I had one clear goal in mind: find out where computers were used on base and become a technical worker there. This was my best and only hope of doing any kind of programming that year. </p><p>It wasn't an easy task. I had to change my mentality and way of thinking because reaching a specific position or place in the army usually doesn't depend on merit alone. Rather, you need to ingratiate yourself with the right people and sweet talk your way in. It's not my style, but I had to practice that social aspect to get where I wanted to be. </p><p>And I did. Within a week of arriving, I grabbed an opportunity to talk with the base leader and I convinced him to let me work in the operations office that had the working computer.</p><h2 id=\"hello-work\">Hello Work</h2><p>Once I was in, I was quickly acquainted with a low spec PC running an outdated version of Windows 7, with 2 GBs of RAM, and no connection to the internet (prohibited). </p><p>My main tasks were typing up word documents and letters, sometimes doing powerpoint presentations, and occasionally fixing the damn printer despite my constant insistence that I had no idea how printers worked!</p><p>Ok, so I didn't have much in terms of computing power or ability to be creative at work. The first few months were physically excruciating because they entailed almost daily fitness testing, hard manual labor, and guard duties with an average of 4 hours of sleep per night. </p><p>Even when I got a rare hour our two of free time at the office alone with the PC, I was usually too exhausted and sometimes fell asleep while sitting at my desk.</p><p>But when I did force myself to focus, I read some ebooks about programming that I snuck in on a USB and hid well on the machine. </p><p>When I was really itching for some actual coding, I opened up powershell and learned how to program in that language using its integrated offline documentation on Windows. Even wrote a few scripts to help with work tasks.</p><p>My next goal was clear: now that I had secured access to a computer, I had to make myself <em>essential</em> in the office I was in. I wanted to be the go-to man for getting work done on the computer. </p><p>This was the advice given to me early on by my predecessor who was my office mentor and who had been the go-to man for the work due to his experience. </p><p>I had to find a way to use this computer to code without raising any alarms or suspicions (people can get really paranoid in the army, especially since I had access to sensitive info). Then I could spend the last few months of my service coding and preparing myself for coding interviews.</p><h2 id=\"i-m-the-captain-now\">I'm the Captain now</h2><p>The office I worked in had three ranks – an officer, 4 sergeants, and 3-5 privates. The officer had his living quarters only a few yards away from office so he rarely showed up. </p><p>He would phone in his commands to the sergeants, and the sergeants, depending on their work ethic, would then order the privates to do most of the tasks related to his commands. </p><p>We also had routine tasks we did on a daily basis. Mostly bureaucratic stuff that was designed to keep military folks working in offices busy. </p><p>Although the sergeants' laziness was annoying and frustrating at times, it meant that they relied heavily on me and other privates to keep the work flowing. They would depend on us so completely at times that they came to the office only a few hours per day, sometimes not at all. They knew that we'd call them if they got summoned or some serious task came up.</p><p>This meant that the office's chain of command went down to the privates based on seniority level. Due to some personnel reshuffling between bases, and my predecessor finishing his service 6 months after I joined, I eventually ended up being the most senior private and therefore the one with the most privilege and authority.</p><p>I was also accountable for most of the work on the computer. The officers would start phoning and summoning me instead of the sergeants because I proved that I was a capable guy. I was, in effect, the person running the office.</p><h2 id=\"preparing-for-coding-interviews\">Preparing for Coding Interviews</h2><p>6 months in, as an older member of the base, I knew how to get out of tricky situations that involved hard manual labor (I used my office's urgent tasks as an excuse to get out of a 2-3 hour pipe-cleaning activity, for example). </p><p>I am quite a diplomatic person, so I made friends with most of the privates and officers. We'd do each other favors which led to less night shift duties, more hours of sleep, and more free time. This meant I had more time to work on my coding skills.</p><p>I decided to learn Vue.js by creating an offline website for the office. The site would help onboard newcomers and explain our routine tasks. It would also show those tasks on a calendar with notifications for upcoming tasks. </p><p>I downloaded Vue on my USB along with <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org\">its offline documentation</a> and Node.js, then transferred them to the army PC. By building the website from scratch and without using any external libraries but Vue itself, I learned a lot about the framework as I went.</p><p>I liked it so much I built <a href=\"https://banhawy.github.io/army-seega/\">a browser game</a> similar to Tic-Tac-Toe and played with the other privates for fun.</p><p>However, it was time to get serious as I had only four months left. Once I got out of the army, I would need to get a job right away, and it needed to be a good one, too. My household was accumulating huge debts since I, the only working family member, was now earning just enough money to buy two family dinners per month. So I couldn't help pay the bills anymore.</p><p>I signed up for a Udacity scholarship for the Full Stack Advanced Web Development track offered via my government's website – and thankfully got accepted. </p><p>This was a great way to refresh my knowledge of full stack development and enhance it. It was a serious commitment that required me to go through the course materials and do multiple graded projects that really tested my learning. </p><p>Thanks to my position at my office, I was able to commit to the program by staying up late at night working on the projects. I connected the old PC to my smartphone's internet so I could use online IDEs and look up stuff. </p><p>This was probably a serious offense from the army's point of view, but I think it was worth the risk. I was able to finish the program on time in three months, and along the way I learned some new technologies, brushed up on important concepts, and solved coding challenges.</p><h2 id=\"applying-to-jobs\">Applying to Jobs</h2><p>I remember when I had 45 days left until I finished my service. I felt ready to start applying for jobs and take on interviews. So I started working on my résumé and applying to jobs I saw online. </p><p>I used LinkedIn primarily for my job search. For the first time ever I was eligible to apply to enterprise companies. Let me explain this bit real quick:</p><p>In my country, according to the labor law, a company cannot officially hire a person and provide them with tax-deductible benefits if that person has not completed their military service and is not exempt from it. &nbsp;</p><p>This meant that, up to that point, no matter how qualified I was, I could only work for smaller business/startups/individuals in an unofficial capacity as an underpaid freelancer (without any benefits or health insurance).</p><p>So now I could apply to any job to my heart's content, and could find positions that matched my expertise. I'd say I applied to about 4-6 jobs (I am super picky).</p><h2 id=\"getting-the-interviews\">Getting the interviews</h2><h3 id=\"vodafone\">Vodafone</h3><p>With 30 days to go, I got my first interview request. This was from Vodafone, a giant mobile network operator, asking me to interview for a senior front end developer role. Cool, cool, cool – I had been contacted by their recruiter earlier on LinkedIn so it was no surprise, except for the \"senior\" bit.</p><p>I remember that the first behavioral interview phone call with one of their recruiters was incredibly awkward for me. I was about to finish a watch shift and hand off my body armor and weaponry to the next soldier, and the phone call came in just before that happened. </p><p>I did try to politely ask for a better time to hold that call or just call back within the hour, but somehow the recruiter convinced me that she was in a hurry and it would be quick. </p><p>The purpose of the call was to test my bilingual speaking ability and gauge my experience. The problem was I had to talk to the lady, in English, while handing off my military equipment to my non-English speaking peer which does look suspicious (we have strict policies about talking to foreigners). But it was a calculated risk, since I knew the guy and he didn't care and was not likely to rat me out.</p><p>Anyways, I ended up getting a coding assignment via email which was basically a few screenshots of a Pokémon listing application. I was asked to try to implement the UI in the pictures, with certain functionality like favoriting and un-favoriting a Pokémon. I was also asked to use React, Redux, TypeScript, and write unit tests in Jest.</p><p>I was given three days to submit the project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/screen1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"screen1\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/screen1.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/screen1.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/screen1.png 1592w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"1592\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>One screen to list Pokémon info retrieved from an exported JSON data</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/screen2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"screen2\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/screen2.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/screen2.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/screen2.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/screen2.png 1611w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\" width=\"1611\" height=\"908\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Another screen to view favorite Pokémon</figcaption></figure><p>Bear in mind that I did not want to ask for an extension or a better time to do the project because I did not want to reveal that I was doing my military service. </p><p>Due to the reasons I mentioned earlier, any company was less likely to consider me for a job because of my unfinished military service status, no matter how long I had left. So I had to take the challenge and do that project in the time provided. </p><p>At least it wasn't a technical interview over zoom which would have been impossible for me.</p><p>There was no way I could build this web app using my phone or even offline on the PC. I needed packages, and I needed to read docs. </p><p>So, using my relatively senior position in my office, I spent those three days pretending to work and study late into the night at the office. I would hook up my phone to the PC and use my phone's data to access the internet and code on an <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io\">online IDE</a>. </p><p>If anyone happened to walk in on me during my all-nighters, all they would see is me staring at an ebook I alt-tabbed into in a foreign language on a strange subject. My phone and cable connection would be well hidden under paperwork and sometimes under my own cap.</p><p>At one point, I was slow to react and a fellow soldier saw me working on my coding assignment but he just assumed I was coding another game or program for fun.</p><p>Despite the hurdles and the lack of sleep during those 3 days, I was able to get most of the project done. I had a functional frontend working that was responsive, cleanly organized and coded, and was pixel-perfect compared to the screenshots I received. I only skimped on the testing part even though its importance was stressed in the assignment instructions. </p><p>Still, I believe I did a good job prioritizing and was ready to discuss my choices and reasoning in the technical interview.</p><p>I really enjoyed this format of candidate assessment as it made me practice and show off my frontend skills. It also served as a clue to the the kinds of projects and tech stack (at least frontend-wise) I'd be working on. </p><p>Nevertheless, my follow-up interview with that team would be about a month later after finishing my military service.</p><h3 id=\"ibm\">IBM</h3><p>The other company I heard back from was IBM. This one was a pleasant surprise. I had applied to one of their job postings on LinkedIn which, in my opinion, had a really vague generic job description. But it really boiled down to an Application Developer (the job title) with working knowledge of cloud development. </p><p>I had that cloud knowledge, although it was mostly self-taught and based on hobby projects. However, I did not have any enterprise experience at that point. I had never worked on a large team, and the biggest development team I collaborated with was 4-5 members strong. </p><p>I think my CV did not adequately reflect that so I made sure to point it out in any upcoming interview.</p><p>Nevertheless, I was very excited to try my luck with IBM. To my disappointment, the first step of the interview process was to pass an online IQ assessment. I've done and passed those before, but I hate them. They do a very good job of triggering my anxiety and making me feel dumb. </p><p>Luckily, I had my smartphone which I used to download apps that let you practice IQ-related assessments in a gamified manner. Lumosity is a good one that I used, among others. </p><p>I spent almost a week practicing whenever I was able, and it was more nerve-wrecking than any face-to-face technical interview I could imagine. </p><p>I think I feared it so much because I believed that this step of the interview was purely automated. I thought it would boil down to a test score number that you needed to pass to get to progress to the actual interview. And the worst part was that you'd never know how well you did or what range they were looking for!</p><p>Anyways, I eventually overcame my anxiety and took the test on my phone (I made sure I was in a private place on base to avoid distractions).</p><p>I would not hear from IBM again until two months later, thankfully after I was out of the army.</p><h2 id=\"catching-up-with-the-industry\">Catching Up with the Industry</h2><p>During my remaining few weeks of military service, I shifted my priorities. Instead of taking courses, reading technical books, and applying for jobs, I started focusing on preparing for interviews and reading online technical blogs to catch up with industry trends. </p><p>I had a lot of time on my hands since my duties were easier to bear and I could delegate to other privates I trained under my command.</p><p>My aim at that point was to just familiarize myself with industry buzzwords, new technologies and stacks, and understand how, when, and more importantly why they were being used. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/\">freeCodeCamp</a> News was an amazing resource I used to browse a lot. I also loved browsing articles and following notable companies' blogs on Medium like <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.medium.com/\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@SlackEng\">Slack</a>.</p><p>Another resource I used a lot was youtube. Again freeCodeCamp has an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ\">amazing YouTube channel</a> covering tons of topics and talks that I watched regularly. I also discovered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/IBMCloud\">IBM Cloud's channel</a> which to this day is my go-to resource for understanding cloud technologies and concepts. </p><p>However, I tried to keep watching videos to a minimum and prioritized reading to avoid consuming all my mobile data and depleting my phone's charge (recharging phones is a hassle if you're not an officer in the army).</p><h2 id=\"gaining-valuable-social-and-work-skills\">Gaining Valuable Social and Work Skills</h2><p>At this point I wanted to highlight a personal insight. It may sound like serving in the army is a huge and unfair challenge that really messes up any career you'd hope to have as a developer. </p><p>And there might be the misconception out there that fresh veterans, no matter how young or old, who are trying to enter the developer job market might be rusty, less knowledgeable, and less up-to-date with current trends compared to other candidates. </p><p>In my case that wasn't true, simply because I was lucky enough to have fairly frequent access to a screen. Others can and do spend years in barren and isolated environments with no access to computers or phones. But even then, don't assume they didn't have access to offline knowledge like books or actual engineers they served with!</p><p>In fact let me make my case that veterans are amongst the most qualified candidates you can hire and work with. The following are the top engineering skills you can expect from most veterans:</p><h3 id=\"good-communication\">Good communication</h3><p>I am a firm believer that the most important skill a developer can have in our industry is good communication. Communication plays a key role in the success of any project, from the requirements gathering stage to the delivery and maintenance of a project. </p><p>The better you are at understanding a project's requirements and at asking the right questions while communicating accurate statuses, the more likely it is that you'll grow in your role and work on successful projects.<br><br>Veterans have been conditioned to follow orders in a quick manner while still being forced to weigh and evaluate every word of each order. We ask <em>only</em> good questions that add essential information required to complete the task. </p><p>In my experience, stupid questions in the military are a taboo that are met with an angry and humiliating backlash. Only the brave soldiers attempt to ask the right questions in vague situations, and any military is full of brave soldiers.</p><h3 id=\"good-social-skills\">Good Social Skills</h3><p>I touched a bit on adopting new social skills, like appealing to superiors to get certain privileges. But that's not the social skills I want you to have in mind when thinking of veterans. </p><p>What I didn't mention is how tightly knit an army base and unit can be despite vast differences that do exist in both personalities and backgrounds. </p><p>I have learned to form strong bonds with people who think so differently from how I think, and who have completely different values than I have. This is because we had to live with each other and watch each others' backs. Sometimes our lives literally depended on the trust we formed.<br><br>That is not to say there weren't bad personalities and conflicts that we had to deal with. But at the end of the day, we depended on each other for survival. We did not have to like each other, but we did have to count on each one doing their job right.<br><br>You can expect a veteran to try to cultivate strong relationships built on trust and to be able to handle conflict well. </p><h3 id=\"creative-problem-solving\">Creative Problem Solving</h3><p>Military personnel (at least in my area) are usually undersupplied, and do not have access to a lot of resources. The only things they have an abundance of are laborious chores and problems to solve. </p><p>In my experience, more often than not, we received seemingly unrealistic commands from officers that just seemed cruel and undoable in a reasonable timeframe.<br><br>These kinds of environments really force soldiers to work and collaborate together to find the most efficient way to execute a task. </p><p>Without much management, you can expect soldiers to start working together in an efficient manner. And they'll usually find creative solutions as quickly as possible (born from a need to get it over with and get some much needed rest in the army).<br><br>You can expect a veteran developer to think outside the box and take on seemingly impossible challenges without much complaint. You'll find only determination and hard work.</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2><p>I finally finished my military service and handed over my duffle-bag on November 30th, 2020. I did my follow-up technical interviews with both Vodafone and IBM in the following month. </p><p>By the start of the new year I had competing offers from both companies, and ended up accepting the one from IBM. I now happily work there as a cloud developer.</p><p>While a lot of people view military service as a waste of time and a hurdle to aspiring developers, I think it proved it to be the opposite for me. If you shift your mindset and learn to adapt, you can really turn this challenge or any similar challenge into a learning opportunity.</p><p>If you are facing a similar challenge that's stopping you from working as a developer even though you want to, my advice would be to not give up. Find a way to turn your situation to your advantage. </p><p>Are you working a boring job with spreadsheets? Learn how to write spreadsheet scripts. Are you only using Word? Build a program that creates Word files and templates. Are you working manual labor in a warehouse or a farm? Listen to technology podcasts. Are there no developer jobs in your area? Make your own! Freelance or build your own digital product.</p><h2 id=\"before-you-go-\"><strong>Before you go...</strong></h2><p>Thank you for reading this far!

website for a client who wanted to receive emails through their website without sharing their email. </p><p>Honestly, I had never tried to implement that functionality myself before. I was always used to having a simple \"Contact Us\" button with an anchor tag and a <code>mailto</code> in the <em>href</em> attribute like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button&gt;\n\t&lt;a href=\"mailto:myemail@example.com\"&gt;Contact Me&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre><p>But this approach has two inconveniences:</p><ol><li>It forces both parties, the user who wants to send the message and the site owner who receives it, to share their emails with one another. While this is OK for some, it is not ideal for privacy-minded individuals.</li><li>For the site visitor, clicking the link forces them to open their default mail program on their device, and that can be frustrating. What if they're using a public computer? What if they're not logged in? What if they simply don't want to use their mail program? <br>Yes, technically they can just grab the recipient's email address and send the message via their browser or wherever they're logged in. But those are all extra steps and hurdles that can discourage users from sending their messages and the business might lose potential feedback or opportunities.</li></ol><p>For this reason, we chose to go with an email form from which the user can simply write in their message and click submit, sending an email to the site's owner without ever leaving the website.</p><p>A quick Google search shows that there are third party tools/widgets that you could embed in a website, but most of them are branded and require paid subscription for full customization. </p><p>And unless you are using a CMS like WordPress that has a built-in plugin that can do that, that's an inconvenient recurring cost. </p><p>I instead chose to code that feature myself so I would have full control.</p><p>For the purposes of this guide I will recreate the steps I took to implement that functionality using HTML and AWS services.</p><h2 id=\"the-html-form\">The HTML Form</h2><p>I'll keep it super simple here and go with a basic HTML form with no CSS, just to test our desired functionality.</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;h2&gt;Contact Us&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;form&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"name\"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;Email:&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input name=\"email\" type=\"email\"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"name\"&gt;Message:&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;textarea name=\"message\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"submit\"/&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;p id=\"result-text\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-61.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-61\" width=\"276\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Nothing fancy to see here...</figcaption></figure><p>Now we want to handle the submit functionality with JavaScript.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">const form = document.querySelector('form')\nform.addEventListener('submit', event =&gt; {\n  // prevent the form submit from refreshing the page\n  event.preventDefault()\n \n  const { name, email, message } = event.target\n  console.log('Name: ', name.value)\n  console.log('email: ', email.value)\n  console.log('Message: ', message.value)\n  \n})\n</code></pre><p>At this point, we have a form that gets input from the user and JavaScript code that just displays the results to the console. </p><p>We can leave it at that for now and start working on the backend services that will receive the form data and send an email with that data.</p><h2 id=\"the-backend-overview\">The Backend Overview</h2><p>Let's dive into AWS and what services we are going to use and how. </p><p>As mentioned in the title, we will use <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> and <strong>Simple Email Service</strong> (SES). SES is a serverless messaging service that allows you to send email messages when invoked. AWS Lambda allows you to write server-side code to execute in response to events. </p><p>We will also use <strong>API Gateway</strong> which enables us to invoke Lambda functions via HTTP.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-62.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-62\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-62.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/image-62.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-62.png 1010w\" width=\"1010\" height=\"772\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In this case, when our form is submitted, the following workflow will happen:</p><ol><li>Our browser (JavaScript) will make a post request, with the form data in the request body, to an endpoint URL specified by AWS API Gateway</li><li>The API Gateway will validate this request. Then it will trigger the Lambda function which accepts an event parameter. API Gateway will put the form data in the body property of the event parameter.</li><li>Our Lambda function will extract the data from the event body and we will then use this data to build the body of the email we want to send as well as its recipients. Our function will then use the AWS SDK to invoke SES with the email data.</li><li>Once SES gets the <em>sendMail</em> request, it turns the email data into an actual text email and sends it to the recipient via AWS's own mail servers.</li></ol><p>Once the email is sent, our browser will receive a response with status code 200 and a success message. If any step in the AWS cloud fails, the response will have a 500 status code.</p><h2 id=\"step-1-how-to-set-up-ses\">Step 1: How to Set Up SES</h2><p>We're actually going to set up each one of these steps in the reverse order, beginning with SES, which is going to be easier.</p><p>First in your AWS console, go to the SES service —&gt; then click on Email Addresses in the side menu —&gt; then click on the \"Verify a New Email Address\" button.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-63.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-63\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-63.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-63.png 781w\" width=\"781\" height=\"215\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In the dialogue that opens up, enter the email address that you want the SES service to put as the <em>sender</em> when it sends the email.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-64.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-64\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-64.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-64.png 761w\" width=\"761\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This will send an email to the email address you put with a link to click to verify. This is how AWS knows that the owner of the email consents to having their email address used as the sender address.</p><p>Until you verify the email, the SES email dashboard will keep the verification status as pending.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-65.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-65\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-65.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-65.png 839w\" width=\"839\" height=\"190\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Once the email owner opens the email they received from AWS and clicks the verification link in it, the verification status should change to verified (refresh the page to see the change).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-66.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-66\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-66.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-66.png 839w\" width=\"839\" height=\"168\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>And that's all you have to do for SES. You can optionally test the service by selecting your verified email in the list and clicking the \"Send a Test Email\" button. This will let you put in a recipient's email address, a subject, and a message and send it.</p><p>The email sent is going to be signed by AWS servers and your verified address should be the sender. It should look like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-67.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-67\" width=\"514\" height=\"299\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"step-2-how-to-set-up-lambda\">Step 2: How to Set Up Lambda</h2><p>Now this is the most fun part. We are going to create a function that is going to receive the form data and call SES. </p><p>The beauty of Lambda functions is that you don't have to worry about running your backend code on a server 24/7 and maintaining that server.

This is why I use <code>JSON.parse</code> on event.body, to turn it into JSON and extract our sender's email, name, and message. Then I use those variables in the email body text and subject using string interpolation.</p><p>If you try the test it, the code will return an error. This is because the test is passing a JSON object to event.body and we are using JSON.parse on JSON, which causes an error in JavaScript. </p><p>Sadly, the test editor doesn't allow us to pass strings to the event, so we'll have to test that later from somewhere else.</p><h2 id=\"step-3-how-to-set-up-api-gateway\">Step 3: How to Set Up API Gateway</h2><p>Next, the last AWS service we are going to use is API Gateway, which will enable our browser to send HTTP requests to the Lambda function we created.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-79.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-79\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-79.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/image-79.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/image-79.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-79.png 1646w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\" width=\"1646\" height=\"402\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Without leaving your lambda function page, expand the \"Function overview\" section and click on \"Add trigger\".</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-80.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-80\" srcset=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-80.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/image-80.png 744w\" width=\"744\" height=\"857\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Next, choose API Gateway from the dropdown, HTTP API as the API type, \"Open\" as the security mechanism, and check the CORS checkbox option.

Economics at a university in Egypt.</p><p>I had fallen in love with programming after taking a few C++ classes.</p><p>I will never forget writing my first for loop and having it execute on screen without errors on the first try. I will never forget my professor telling me that I have good coding skills, and great potential if I keep it up.</p><p>Coding just made sense. Creating something and watching it come to life is the most rewarding experience that I have ever had in academia.</p><p>But due to political unrest at the time, I had to leave Egypt in 2013 and study abroad. I ended up in University of California Riverside, where I chose to continue my degree in Economics because it would allow me to graduate in shorter amount of time, and cost my family less money.</p><p>I thought I’d keep coding as a hobby on the side, and maybe get a job as a developer later on. I didn’t realize it at the time, but this mistake would cost me dearly.</p><h3 id=\"broke-in-california\">Broke in California</h3><p>After a string of mediocre professors, I came to hate economics. I no longer found the subject interesting at all.</p><p>I had <em>no idea</em> what I was going to do with a degree in Economics, and no work experience after I graduated. It turned out as legal foreign student, I had the right to work for a year. But there was a catch: I could only work in a job that was related to my field of study (economics).</p><p>So I couldn’t even work as developer intern no matter how good I was!</p><p>That crushed me. I had been learning web development on my own — HTML, CSS, and even experimenting with Ruby on Rails. (All this was before <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-freecodecamp-helped-me-get-a-job-and-turn-my-life-around-5ffe807085cf/undefined\" rel=\"noopener\">Quincy Larson</a> had even created freeCodeCamp.)</p><p>I had to bite the bullet. I got a job as life insurance agent at a Fortune 100 company. After two months of unpaid training, they let me go on my <em>first day of work</em> after the manager found out that I would not be able to work for more than 1 year without sponsoring. I had told them all about this potential issue in advance, but the company apparently had an internal miscommunication.</p><p>I was stuck in an apartment lease, and had to pay rent from my parents’ savings.</p><p>Over the next 6 months, I desperately hunted for jobs and practiced coding all I could. I got better at coding, but job hunting in California was terrible.</p><p>I finally relocated to Austin, Texas to work there as a business analyst and market researcher. I moved there after a discussion with the CEO himself, who said he understood my circumstances and that I would need sponsorship of my visa soon. We agreed and my situation seemed to be resolved.</p><p>I did a good job there. I was quickly promoted to a Project Coordinator thanks to my coding knowledge, and got to work with both the marketing team and the technical team.</p><p>I took part in some QA testing and scrum meetings. Seeing and working with real developers reminded me of how much I loved software development. But actually working in software development as an Economics major on a visa was a distant dream. So I tried to convince myself that maybe I could grow into a project management position, and find a way to be passionate about it someday.</p><h3 id=\"a-grave-clerical-error\">A Grave Clerical Error</h3><p>I worked with that company for 8 months before I was notified that my work visa was not accepted. Apparently, the HR department had taken too long and submitted my visa paperwork later than the government required.</p><p>Even though I had this brief period of income stability, I was never really happy. I felt like a robot doing random tasks dictated by others in a small office. Sure, I had amazing coworkers and a great boss, but I did not like where I was in life.</p><p>It seemed pointless. I had periods of depression that I never experienced before. I would curl up in bed and flat-out cry.</p><p>I convinced myself that maybe it was a hormonal imbalance because of an unhealthy diet or something else.</p><p>Anyway, the point is, I was screwed all over again. And now I faced a choice:</p><ol><li>pack my stuff and go back to Egypt, where I would have to wait a year before serving in the military for 2 years. (All young men living in Egypt have to serve in the military.)</li><li>pursue another degree so I could legally stay in the US as a student.</li></ol><p>After much persuasion from my family, I decided to stay and go to graduate school in Minnesota.</p><p>Why Minnesota? My mother knew a person who had an accounting firm there, who also persuaded me to come over and work in his firm as an accountant. He convinced me to enroll in any school for just one or two quarters while I worked for him and he promised to get me the work visa.</p><p>At this point, I really had no choice. Either go back to unemployment and war in the desert, or stay in the US and hope for a better future. So I packed my stuff and relocated yet again to Minnesota.</p><p>I got into a random private school, and it was so late in the year that the only degree program still accepting students was called “Organizational Industrial Psychology.”</p><p>I waited for the accounting firm guy to keep his promise of a job at his CPA firm.</p><p>He didn’t.</p><p>I was yet again stuck in a degree program in which I had no interest. I was running out of money. So I took a job as a warehouse worker so I could afford to pay my rent.</p><p>I had to get up everyday at 6 am and drive through snow blizzards, so I could work a minimum wage job packaging products. Then I went to classes at night and pretended to be interested while the university took my money — just so I could continue to stay in the US legally while I tried to figure out what to do.</p><p>I was living alone. I knew no one. And I could not make friends. It was almost Christmas, and I had hit complete rock bottom. Extreme depression was a daily companion. My primary goal each day was to keep myself from becoming suicidal.</p><h3 id=\"freecodecamp-to-the-rescue\">freeCodeCamp to the Rescue</h3><p>I started <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org\" rel=\"noopener\">freeCodeCamp.org</a> in winter of 2016. I don’t remember how I found out about it.</p><p>After spending a small fortune on American universities, I was extremely skeptical. I read about the certificates they had, and heard about the quality of the program. “<em>All that for free? There has to be a catch. There is always a catch</em>.”</p><p>Well I checked it out, and it turns out there was a catch. It wasn’t that you had to pay money. Money couldn’t help you here. The catch was you had to make time to work through progressively harder coding challenges.</p><p>Well, I was completely fine with that!</p><p>Once I started doing the challenges, I was once again reminded of the potential my computer science professor had said he’d seen in me. I was reminded of what I wanted to become in life. And I was immediately hooked.</p><p>I had already taught myself some basic HTML and CSS, and had a vague understanding of some Computer Science concepts. freeCodeCamp was the perfect refresher, and a practice tool to get better. I take all my knowledge and build stuff with it!</p><p>I started doing the challenges, and I remember at one point I had a streak longer than 30 days. This was the best distraction from my depression and my collapsing life. And it was the only thing in the world giving me any kind of joy.</p><h3 id=\"back-to-school-with-a-web-developer-job\">Back to School with A Web Developer Job</h3><p>Slowly but surely, doing the challenges and projects on freeCodeCamp started to give me a confidence boost and build up my morale. Just trying to solve those algorithms and problems on freeCodeCamp encouraged me to solve my own life problems — namely, the being-at-rock-bottom problem.</p><p>So I started breaking down my problem to see how I could tackle them:</p><ul><li><strong>What do I really want in life?</strong> <em>Happiness</em></li><li><strong>What makes me happy?</strong> <em>Coding</em></li><li><strong>How can I code for a living?</strong> <em>Become a developer</em></li><li><strong>How can I legally become a developer? </strong>(remember I am an alien, not even an immigrant) <em>Get a CS degree</em></li></ul><p>So I decided to apply for the Computer Science undergraduate program at the University Of Minnesota in the Twin Cities.</p><p>I went to the director of admissions and explain to her my situation. Luckily, I had not missed their deadlines and she assured me I would get in easily because of all my previous coursework, including the CS courses I took back in Egypt.</p><p>This was it. I was betting all my cards on that final chance. This was the biggest risk I had ever taken, and frankly the only life decision I made without influence from family or friends.</p><p>While I was waiting to hear back about my admission, I started looking for jobs available at the university. There was an internship opening for a web developer position that involved managing all the university’s websites and analytics. It required knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js — all of which I had worked and — thanks to freeCodeCamp — had a portfolio of projects to prove it.</p><p>Just before Christmas Eve, I received an acceptance letter from the computer science department. But I still had no answer from my job application. In order for all of this to work out, I needed that job to pay my rent, because I had to leave my warehouse job before school started.</p><p>Two weeks after classes started, I got a call from the project manager at the University Relations office where I had applied for the position. She asked me to come in for an interview at the beginning of February.</p><p>I went for my first ever interview. It was with the project manager and a senior web developer from the office. They asked me questions about my previous work experience, which had never directly involved web development. But they had seen my portfolio, and asked me some questions about Node.js and JavaScript. I managed to solve all of them. I don’t remember what they were, but they weren’t too hard, and were meant to check whether I had basic web dev knowledge.</p><p>Considering that my entire life was on the line, I was pretty confident and relaxed. I think I made a good impression.</p><p>A few days later the project manager called and asked me to start working the following week.</p><h3 id=\"the-internship-the-degree-the-freecodecamp\">The Internship, The Degree, The freeCodeCamp</h3><p>Holy crap a computer science degree is intense. There is little-to-no coding, and a whole lot of math and pseudo code. Granted they did teach me C during my first semester, but that was just to compile it into assembly language, then translate it back and forth.</p><p>But I found some of the complicated math and deep logic actually useful, and had some applications in web development. Like using a matrix representation of a grid system to move CSS elements in the DOM, and to create custom effects. Or using known proof methods to solve complicated algorithms. But it is HARD and being a full time student made it impossible for me to continue doing freeCodeCamp.</p><p>The web developer internship on the other hand, was part-time 20 hours/week. I’d go from class to work and from work to class. I got to actually use the web development fundamentals that freeCodeCamp taught me at work, and I still had to learn other web dev tools like Sass, Gulp, GitHub, and working with Linux servers.</p><p>Even though as an on-campus employee I’m getting paid minimum wage, this experience is invaluable and is exactly what I need. I LOVE what I’m doing and I LOVE going to work. I might have had the Imposter Syndrome at the beginning, but I was so determined to get better. I’ve come a long way since February.</p><p>Now that I don’t have school in the summer, I still work at the university, but I also went back to finish the freeCodeCamp projects and challenges, and am trying to learn React in my free time.</p><p>Oh, and along the way, I met my first girlfriend. We’ve decided to get married after graduation. I’ve also made a lot of good friends, and have a game plan for once in my life.</p><p>I am working my ass off to become the best software engineer I can be so I can apply to an internship at the Big Four tech companies by the end of this year.</p><p>Even though I’m struggling financially now worse than ever, I have overcome my depression and have become a confident, fast-learning developer. I know for sure that I am on the right path, that I just need to keep doing what I love, and eventually I’ll be successful and happy.</p><h3 id=\"moving-forward\">Moving forward</h3><p>The journey of becoming a developer is not easy. I have to thank <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-freecodecamp-helped-me-get-a-job-and-turn-my-life-around-5ffe807085cf/undefined\" rel=\"noopener\">Quincy Larson</a> and all of the freeCodeCamp community for putting me on the right track. They helped me turn my life around when I had lost all hope.</p><p>This is definitely not the end of the road. The journey doesn’t stop once you get the job.</p><p>I hope the takeaway for anyone who read this far is to do what you love, no matter what the odds are. Don’t force yourself to do anything you’re not passionate about, because it can be a major cause of depression.</p><p>Keep on coding and have fun doing it!</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;
