to land your dream job, you probably think of just about everything but the font. But font is a key part of your first impression to recruiters and employers.</p><p>In this post, I’m going to walk you through the 10 best fonts for your resume (and when to use each). We’ll also talk about why employers care about font choice and how you can use it to set yourself apart from the competition.</p><h2 id=\"does-your-resume-font-really-matter\">Does Your Resume Font Really Matter?</h2><p>Imagine an ad for a sleek, ultra-thin cell phone. What kind of design and font do you picture in the marketing materials?</p><p>You probably dreamed up something as slender and condensed as the phone itself. You wouldn’t expect a marketing team to use anything flowery, ornate, or thick and bold if they’re trying to get customers to think thin:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iPhone-XR-Ad-illustrating-the-impact-of-font-choice.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"iPhone XR Ad illustrating the impact of font choice\" width=\"1646\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple.com</a></em></em></p><p>Now imagine an ad for a fantasy novel. How would the words pop on the page?</p><p>You probably didn’t imagine something traditional and straightforward, right? If you’re going to dive into a fairy tale universe packed with dragon-slayers and towering castles, you’ll probably expect to see a font with a few flourishes and curlicues.</p><p>Font choice is a crucial part of any marketing team’s design. Every aspect of an advertisement’s design, from the imagery to the layout and the way the words appear on the page, should get a potential customer thinking positively about the product or service being sold.</p><p>When you craft your resume, think of yourself as a marketing team of one. You’re designing for the recruiter’s or employer’s first impression of you with your cover letter and resume. You’re selling yourself in every aspect of your self-branding, from content to timeliness and format.</p><p>When your name lands on an employer’s desk or in their inbox, you want them to come away with a great impression of you. They aren’t seeing you in person, and there are no other context clues to give them any other ideas than what you present them with–even something as seemingly small as format or font. Because everything they see about you will be written in your chosen font, it will make a much bigger difference than you might imagine.</p><p>You don’t have to take my word for it, either. There’s plenty of scientific evidence to prove that font affects consumers’ perceptions of a product or company, and employers’ perceptions of job applicants:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Psychology-of-Font-Selection-Infographic.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The Psychology of Font Selection (Infographic)\" width=\"816\" height=\"1056\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.228&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One study at Wichita State University</a>, for example, showed that respondents associated fonts like Times New Roman and Arial with stability. Courier New and Georgia meant “maturity” in participants’ minds, while Agency FB was associated with rigidity and Kristen symbolized excitement.</p><p><a href=\"http://japr.or.kr/journal/article.php?code=25772\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Other research indicates</a> that it’s not just the font choice, but the consistency of that choice with other aspects of marketing, that really makes the difference. If font and other visual and tonal elements (like resume design, formatting, paragraphs, graphics, and style choices like bold and italics) all give the same consistent message — such as “this applicant has the relevant skills,” “this applicant is reliable and dependable,” or “this applicant is creative and visually-oriented,” that message is likelier to stick in your reader’s brain. But if just one aspect, like font, is off, it could undermine the entire message, weakening every aspect of your introduction.</p><p>Remember that the presentation of your resume and cover letter together are a way for you to self-brand. If your brand messaging is consistent across design and content, form and function, font and tone, you’re much likelier to make a sale–or, in this case, to get invited for an interview.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-big-deal-about-resume-fonts-anyways\">What’s the Big Deal About Resume Fonts Anyways?</h2><p>So, why does a small thing like font choice make such a big impact on your ability to get hired?</p><p>Our brains make connections every second, working overtime to flesh out the meaning of everything we read and see. We connect certain aesthetics and words with emotions, character traits, and moods.</p><p>Think about it: You’d probably feel confused if you went to a fresh fruit smoothie shop and saw grungey, gritty, dark decor. That’s because, due to your past experiences, you probably already associate smoothie shops with breezy, tropical environments and bright, cheery colors.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/463196/how-typeface-influences-way-read-think\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">typeface designer and author Cyrus Highsmith told <em><em>The Week</em></em></a><em><em>,</em></em> “Typography is the detail and the presentation of a story. It represents the voice of an atmosphere, or historical setting of some kind. It can do a lot of things.”</p><p>Think of the typography as the mood-setter for your resume; instead of lighting a candle, you’re creating an atmosphere with the aesthetic of your font and other design choices.</p><p>We bring our past experiences and myriad associations to everything we do. Your resume font should activate those connections in your recruiters’ and potential employers’ minds, causing them to connect you with traits like professionalism, honesty, and skill.</p><p>Like each applicant, <a href=\"https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/976758/1/MR71016.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">each font has a “personality.”</a> If a font is difficult to read or doesn’t reflect the job you’re applying for, it could leave a recruiter with a bad taste in their mouth (even if they aren’t aware of it). And because you’ve already put so much thought and effort into your resume, you don’t want something small like font selection to have a negative impact.</p><p>Next, we’ll go over how to make the best possible impression with your resume typeface. Once you choose a font you like, you can use <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/resume-templates/\">my free resume builder</a> to create a beautiful, ATS-friendly resume with our recruiter approved templates.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-choose-the-best-font-for-your-resume\">How to Choose the Best Font for Your Resume</h2><p>The two most important factors when selecting a font for your resume are readability and professionalism.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is to make a recruiter or employer’s life harder, so your resume font should always be straightforward and highly readable. They shouldn’t have to squint to read overly light, thin fonts, or struggle to make out complex symbols or typefaces.</p><p>Professionalism, meanwhile, is all about tone. Just as we discussed in the previous section, even “silent” choices like font and formatting can convey tone as easily as your word choice. The tone of your font should match the tone of your workplace personality and your level of professionalism.</p><p>In terms of both readability and professionalism, there are a few broad “font families” that we commonly associate with the workplace and with professional settings. Let’s go over each of the five main font families, or broad categories, from which you have to choose when you’re writing your resume or CV.</p><h3 id=\"the-differences-between-font-families-\">The Differences Between “Font Families”</h3><p>Every font belongs to a “family” of fonts, which have similar characteristics and leave similar (though not identical) impressions. The first decision you have to make in terms of selecting a resume font is which font family is best for your goals.</p><p>These are the five broad categories that fonts fall into:</p><p><strong><strong>Serif:</strong></strong> Serif fonts, like Times New Roman, belong to one of the largest and most common “font families.” Letters in serif fonts have decorative serifs, or little “tails,” on certain character strokes.</p><p><strong><strong>Sans Serif:</strong></strong> Sans serif literally means “without serif,” so you can guess these typefaces don’t have–tails! Examples of sans serif typefaces include Arial and Helvetica. Sans serif typefaces have become highly popular in the digital marketplace, partly because of their less formal, more straightforward and minimalist look.</p><p><strong><strong>Monospace:</strong></strong> Commonly associated with newspapers and typewriters, monospace fonts like Courier and Courier New were designed so that each letter would take up the same amount of space on a given line. Each letter is the same width. This allows for clean, consistent graphic design, as there’s no size variability between the characters. Monospace fonts have also become a popular design choice in recent years because they’re a bit nostalgic, calling back to the days of typewriters and telegrams.</p><p><strong><strong>Cursive:</strong></strong> Cursive fonts, like the famous Comic Sans, are meant to appear handwritten or “scribbled” to give text a personalized touch. Certain fonts in this category might be rarely used in professional settings, but in the vast majority of cases, these are used for graphic design or marketing materials rather than cover letters or CVs.</p><p><strong><strong>Fantasy:</strong></strong> Fantasy fonts are not useful for resumes or cover letters–there might be an out-there exception, but I haven’t found any yet–but they are used for decorative and design purposes, like signage and certain marketing materials. Examples of fantasy typefaces include Impact and Western. They are typically used for headers or other shorter texts, because they’re not the easiest to read.</p><p><strong><strong>Our recommendation for 2019:</strong></strong> With the five font families to choose from, what’s the best option for your resume?</p><p>In today’s world, a clean, modern sans serif font is recommended. This is partly because the workforce has gone increasingly digital, making even professional interactions slightly less formal and more straightforward and concise.</p><p>Sans serif fonts are more contemporary in look and feel than the more conformist and traditional serif fonts. They cater to today’s minimalist, cut-to-the-chase, 280-character-driven economy. They cut out all the extra distraction and get right to the point, just like you want to do in your job search.</p><p>While you might make a different decision for your resume font in your job search–if you’re in an ultra-traditional and more conservative profession that expects a high level of formality, for example — sans serif fonts are generally the best option.<br>Now that we’ve narrowed it down to a certain font family, we’ll break down the top 10 best resume fonts and what job categories they might be ideal for.</p><h2 id=\"breaking-down-the-10-best-resume-fonts\">Breaking Down The 10 Best Resume Fonts</h2><p>In 2019’s marketplace, these are the 10 best resume fonts based on reliability, perception, and style:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Open Sans (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Calibri (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Helvetica (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Avenir (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Lato (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Roboto (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Avant Garde (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Museo (Modern)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Georgia (Classic)</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Garamond (Classic)</strong></strong></li></ul><p>For each one, we’ll delve a bit into the font’s history and aesthetic, as well as its pros and cons and when to use each:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Open-Sans-Font-for-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Open Sans Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"open-sans\">Open Sans</h2><p>Open Sans, released in 2011, is one of Google’s signature fonts. Its letters are tall and wide.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Open Sans is wildly popular for web design for a reason: optimal readability. The wide-open letters are easy to read on any screen, big or small. Because it’s used as Mozilla’s default font in many cases, and for many Google pages, it’s familiar to the eye.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Open Sans is widely perceived as “flat” or “neutral,” which can be a very good thing for a resume. But if you want to stand out a bit or for your resume to have a bit more personality, it might not be the best choice.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> Adelle Sans is similar to Open Sans and is a great substitute.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Calibri-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Calibri Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"calibri\">Calibri</h2><p>Calibri came on the scene in the early 2000s as the Microsoft Word replacement for the classic Times New Roman.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Calibri can be easily read on any computer and won’t mess up the formatting no matter where it’s sent. Everyone has seen it before, so it’s not distracting. It’s a sans serif font, so it’s clean and sleek. It’s a good choice for a standard resume or for work at a digital-first company.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Calibri is a little “safe,” as it’s the default Microsoft Word font and is used by many other applicants. But standing out from the pack isn’t always the best goal when it comes to resume font. Instead, you want your resume itself to do the work. But Calibri might not be the best choice for a creative career at a quirky company.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternative:</strong></strong> Arial, which is the default typeface for Google Docs, is somewhat similar to Calibri in its optimal readability for the web. It’s also similarly straightforward and legible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Helvetica-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Helvetica Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"helvetica\">Helvetica</h2><p>Helvetica was designed in the 1950s and comes with a little bit of elegance and flourish. It’s frequently rated as one of the more attractive typefaces.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Helvetica is a softer, beautiful sans serif typeface. It’s modern while still being a bit pretty and not too stark. Because it’s not always used for resumes, it stands out a bit without being too far “out there.” It might be a good choice for a design company (especially because <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joeflory/15-modern-alternatives-to-helvetica-2c4b2f602a9a\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it’s frequently used in graphic design</a>) or a profession that puts a premium on aesthetic.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Helvetica is only pre-loaded on Macs, so it will convert to a different font on other systems.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> Swiss, Arial, and Folio are all similar to Helvetica in “font personality.”</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Avenir-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Avenir Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"avenir\">Avenir</h2><p>Avenir comes from the French word meaning “future.” Designed in 1988, this geometric sans serif font is warm and lively, with curved edges and a few selective tails.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Avenir isn’t odd enough to be distracting, but it’s not a standard “safe” resume font. It might be a good choice for a future-forward company. It’s also <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/avenir\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consistently rated one of the favorite fonts of designers</a>, so it could be good for any aesthetic-focused or creative profession. Finally, it’s versatile: It comes in a variety of weights.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Avenir is not a very common choice for resumes, so it might be a tad jarring to a highly traditional or formal eye.<br>Alternatives: Nunito, with its rounded letters, is very similar to Avenir.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Lato-Font-for-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Lato Font for Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"lato\">Lato</h2><p>Lato, designed in 2010, is named after the Polish word for “summer” because it was meant to be as cheery as the warmest season. It is professional enough to be serious, but has a touch of brightness in its typeface style.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Lato is an increasingly common choice for resumes because of how readable it is. It’s an approachable and stylish font, while remaining professional. Finally, Lato is open-source, which means anyone can download it for free.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Lato is not one of the resume “classics,” which is always a tiny bit of a gamble. Microsoft Word does not list Lato as one of its defaults, which means it won’t show up for every recruiter or employer. If you download and install the font, make sure you send your resume to PDF format so the recruiter/hiring manager will see the same formatting you do!</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> <a href=\"https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/articles/the-best-free-alternatives-to-the-most-popular-fonts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandon Grotesque</a> and Open Sans are both similar to Lato.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Roboto-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Roboto Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"roboto\">Roboto</h2><p>Released by Google in 2011, Roboto probably looks familiar, especially if you do a lot of traveling: It’s used for Google Maps. It’s similar to the other fonts optimized for the web, with a more slender, sleek typeface.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Because it’s open-source, Roboto is free for anyone to use. It’s also optimized for web readability, so like Open Sans, it’s legible on any screen. It’s also sleek and contemporary, so it’s great for any modern company, especially those that put web presence at a premium (such as marketing).</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Roboto appears a little less formal than some other fonts, so it’s not ideal for academic applications or very traditional work environments.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> Roboto is somewhat similar in style to Helvetica and Arial.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Avant-Garde-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example-of-Avant-Garde-Font-For-Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"avant-garde\">Avant Garde</h2><p>Inspired by the 1920s German Bauhaus movement, Avant Garde is a unique typeface that is having a comeback after being <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/itc-avant-garde-gothic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">used frequently in 1970s advertisements.</a> Its letters are wide, and several of them have quirky flourishes, like the sloped “v” and curliqued Q.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Avant Garde is interesting enough to stand out while remaining readable for the web. It’s a solid choice for creative types and people who want to highlight their unique personalities.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Avant Garde is, well, avant garde. It’s not a default or standard resume font, so it’s not the best choice for an executive-level position in a traditional field.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> Avant Garde is similar to Harmonia Sans.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Museo-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Museo Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"museo\">Museo</h2><p>Released in 2009, Museo <a href=\"https://www.exljbris.com/museo.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">began with the uppercase “U,”</a> with two flatly curved horizontal tails. It’s warm and approachable.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Museo is frequently used in web design. It would be a great choice for a customer service or sales job that requires a friendly, open demeanor, or for work in an artisanal or artistic field like fashion or design. It’s open-source, so it’s free to use.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Museo is warm and friendly, but that can be a drawback if your recruiter is highly traditional. It might be distracting in some cases.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> Use Calvert in place of Museo if you’re looking for a similar vibe.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Georgia-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Georgia Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"georgia\">Georgia</h2><p>Georgia was released in 1993 and is widely used by companies like Amazon, The New York Times, and Yahoo as a default font. It’s a serif font, so it has a classic look with a bit of warmth.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Georgia was specifically designed to be read on screens, so it’s highly accessible for screen readers with visual impairments and is legible even on mobile phones. It’s professional and standard while still having a touch of fun and flair.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Georgia is so widely used and familiar that it might not make you stand out among other applicants.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> Georgia and Times New Roman are often used interchangeably. Georgia almost appears to be an “updated” version of TNR.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Garamond-Font-For-Resume.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of Garamond Font For Resume\" width=\"1620\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"garamond\">Garamond</h2><p>Garamond came out in 1989, but it has a much longer history. The typeface was inspired by 16th-century design and is often used in print.</p><p><strong><strong>Pros:</strong></strong> Garamond <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/garamond\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has an old-school, vintage look</a> that lends it a touch of class. It’s a good example of a font with a distinct personality, making it a solid choice for academic or literary fields.</p><p><strong><strong>Cons:</strong></strong> Garamond’s retro look means it’s probably not ideal for ultra-contemporary companies.</p><p><strong><strong>Alternatives:</strong></strong> Cormorant, Sabon, and Minion are strong alternatives to Garamond.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-font-size-for-your-resume\">The Best Font Size for Your Resume</h2><p>Remember that readability is one of the most important aspects of resume font choice.</p><p>Font size is a key aspect of your reader’s ability to scan your resume quickly, pick out the important parts, and come away with a solid, positive impression of you. A recruiter might be sifting through dozens or even hundreds of resumes at a time (or more), and making their job simpler is the first and easiest way to make yours stand out in a good way.</p><p>It can be be tempting to cram every last thing you’ve ever done onto your resume, but cutting out the extraneous parts of your work history can do you some good in more ways than one. With too many sections on your resume, it can quickly become overwhelming to the eye.</p><p>What’s more, if you include too much content, you’ll probably be required to shrink your font size to 10 (never, ever go below 10!). But a slightly larger font size gives employers a better impression; <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.729.5271&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one study at Stephen F. Austin University</a>showed that resumes using 12-pt. font were evaluated more highly than those in 10-pt. font.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Data-Shows-Recruiters-Prefer-12-Point-Resume-Font.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Charting Visualizing Data That Shows Recruiters Prefer 12 Point Resume Font\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Since the ultimate goal is to make your resume as easy to read as you possibly can, the optimal font size is between 12 and 14. 10 can be used if you’re highly experienced and have an extremely lengthy resume, but it’s not ideal. Try cutting out a few things that aren’t directly relevant to the job at hand and see if you can make your resume a little easier on the eyes with a larger font.</p><p>This exercise can also improve your resume overall by making it more straightforward and concise. No matter how much you might want to include your high school volunteer history, it’s much more important that a recruiter sees only the most relevant and applicable education and work experience right away–no muss, no fuss.</p><p>In the same vein, be wary of any light or thin fonts, as your reader will likely get frustrated if your resume is hard to read. Use black instead of grey or any other color so that your resume is optimized for readability.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-leverage-formatting-to-make-your-resume-font-pop\">How to Leverage Formatting to Make Your Resume Font Pop</h3><p>In addition to choosing a font, you can also use various formatting styles to make certain areas of your resume stand out.</p><p>The first rule of resume formatting is to use any special styles, like bold or italics, sparingly. You don’t want your reader to feel overwhelmed by mixed styles or too many italics sections on a page. Be selective about any special characters. White space is your resume’s best friend, and will allow your reader to scan the documents quickly, cherry-picking the most important parts with ease.</p><p>The next rule of using bold and italics on your resume are to do so consistently. It might seem like an obvious rule, but it’s also often broken. If you bold your previous job titles and use italics for subtitles, for example, do so for every previous job you list, even if they’re different in some way. Establish a pattern with your style choices right away, and your reader will follow your lead.</p><p>You can use bold in your resume to highlight specific key aspects of your background that are relevant to a given job, or to set apart particular sections for optimal scannability. For example, you could use bold to highlight special skills you used (such as expertise in a given software program) that are specifically mentioned in the job description. Or, you could use bold, along with a slightly larger font size, for headings.</p><p>Italics, meanwhile, are best used for subtitles below headings, or for extra emphasis on a specific aspect of your education or work history, like measurable outcomes. For example, you could use italics to denote the dates during which you worked at a particular job. They’re also frequently used to share quantitative data, like “Grew quarterly sales by 13%.”</p><h3 id=\"how-to-find-download-non-standard-resume-fonts-for-free-\">How To Find &amp; Download Non-Standard Resume Fonts (For Free!)</h3><p>You may have noticed that a few of the fonts I recommended don’t show up when you try to find them in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.</p><p>Despite being some of the best choices out there for your resume, these fonts aren’t always part of the standard package with Microsoft or Google.

When in doubt, select a contemporary sans serif typeface and a 12-14-pt. font size. Use bold and italics consistently but sparingly, and remember that white space is your friend.</p><p>In addition, the way we’ve thought about resume fonts in this article is a good model for how you should approach all of your introductory materials during the job application process.</p><p>Every aspect of your cover letter and CV or resume should be carefully curated to highlight relevant experience and traits. And because your potential employer doesn’t have anything to go on other than what you provide them with, it’s important to make every letter – and every typeface – count.</p><h4 id=\"want-the-inside-info-on-landing-a-dream-job-without-connections-without-experience-without-applying-online\"><strong>Want the inside info on landing a dream job without connections, without “experience,” &amp;

you today. Thank you for the recommendation to read The Power of Less, maybe we can trade notes when you’re done with Tribes! We will be in touch about next steps soon.”</em></em></p><p>That was part of a reply I received to a post-interview thank you email I wrote to a VP of sales. Four hours after receiving that reply, I got a call from the recruiter offering me a job.</p><p>A month after I was hired, I had a one-on-one with that VP and the first question she asked me was about the books we recommended to each other.</p><p>Leading up to the thank you email, we had spent 40 minutes on the phone together talking through introductions, behavioral questions, and case studies to see if I was a good fit for the role. While that conversation factored into the decision, my answers weren’t what stood out in her mind.</p><p>It was the personal touch that stuck.</p><p>As a candidate, you want to be focused on two things during the job search:</p><ol><li><strong>How can I build relationships with people who can influence the hiring decision</strong></li><li><strong>How can I stand out from all of the other candidates vying for this job</strong></li></ol><p>The post interview thank you email is a highly effective (and incredibly easy) tactic that covers both bases. It’s also overlooked by 76% of job seekers. Talk about low hanging fruit!</p><p>After interviewing at dozens of companies with over 100 people, I’ve had the chance to send (and test) plenty of thank you notes. This article will walk you through the template I’ve found to be the most effective and helped me land jobs at leading companies like Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and more.</p><h2 id=\"why-the-post-interview-thank-you-matters\"><strong><strong>Why The Post-Interview Thank You Matters</strong></strong></h2><p>Before we get technical, it’s important to understand why writing a thank you note is important in the first place.</p><p>Most people think their interview is over when they walk out of the building. Whether they absolutely crushed it or things didn’t go according to plan, it’s out of their hands now, right?</p><p>Not so fast.</p><p>Hiring managers at top companies pay very close attention to how and when their candidates follow up. Most are expecting some sort of thank you and failing to send one actually could cost you the job.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/job-interview-tips/a-little-thanks-goes-a-long-way?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The data reveals</a> that close to 80% of hiring managers feel that thank you notes are helpful when deciding between candidates. 22% of employers are<em><em> </em></em>less likely to hire a candidate who does <strong><strong>not</strong></strong> send a thank you and <a href=\"http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2012-06-14-Survey-Reveals-Email-Phone-Call-Are-Preferred-Methods-for-Post-Interview-Follow-Up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">91% actually <em><em>like</em></em> being thanked</a> (imagine that!).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Accountemps-Survey-Results-On-Interview-Thank-You-Notes.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Accountemps Thank Note Survey Data Graphic\" width=\"1588\" height=\"812\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In addition to playing into your potential employer’s expectations, thank you notes are an easy way to stand out from the competition. Despite all of the data above, only 24% of job seekers actually take the time to send a thank you note after their interview.</p><h2 id=\"part-1-the-basics-of-a-great-thank-you-email\"><strong><strong>Part 1: The Basics of a Great Thank You Email</strong></strong></h2><p>Before we dive into our post-interview thank you email templates and examples, we’re going to walk through the fundamentals of sending a thank you note that will boost your chances of landing the job offer.</p><h3 id=\"should-i-email-call-or-hit-them-up-on-twitter\">Should I Email, Call, Or Hit Them Up On Twitter?</h3><p>If you run a Google search for “interview thank you notes,” you’ll get all sorts of suggested mediums for sending – email, phone calls, Twitter, text messages, and even hand written notes.</p><p>All of these can get the job done but we want to choose the method that’s going to make things fast and easy for the interviewer on the other end.</p><p>Rather than sliding into their DMs, the data shows that interviewers prefer receiving thank you notes via email (with phone calls coming in at a close second):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Graphic-of-Survey-Results-on-Preferred-Thank-You-Note-Medium.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graphic of Survey Results on Preferred Thank You Note Medium\" width=\"1412\" height=\"862\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>When you’re in the room on interview day, it’s much more natural to ask for someone’s email than their phone number. On top of that email allows you to spend time crafting your response and you can track your them using a tool like <a href=\"http://www.yesware.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yesware</a> to help gauge interest.</p><p>For those reasons, I recommend sending all of your thank you notes via email.</p><p><em><em>“But what if I forgot to ask for their email and don’t have it?”</em></em></p><p>No problem! There are plenty of tools out there that make it super easy to track down someone’s email address. Two of my favorites are <a href=\"http://www.hunter.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hunter.io</a> and <a href=\"http://www.voilanorbert.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VoilaNorbert.com</a>. All you need is the person’s full name and the link to their company’s website (so if they work at Tesla, it would be www.tesla.com).</p><p>After you’ve got your hands on their email, head over to <a href=\"http://www.mailtester.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mail Tester</a> and plug it in to verify that it exists on the company’s email server. If it does, you’re good to go!</p><p>If all else fails, you can always email your recruiter and ask them for the person’s contact info. Sure, it’s best to get it up front but you’re better off swallowing your pride to send your thank you email than sending nothing at all.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-the-best-time-to-send-your-thank-you\">When Is The Best Time To Send Your Thank You?</h3><p>This is a question I get a lot.</p><p>When it comes to following up with hiring managers, posting articles on social media, or sending breaking news to a contact, timing is everything and there is a science behind it.</p><p>When it comes to thank you notes, the golden rule is simple:</p><blockquote><em><em>Send your thank you as quickly as you can while still allowing yourself enough time to craft a quality email.</em></em></blockquote><p>If you’re a numbers person, shoot for 30 minutes – 2 hours after the interview, but don’t pull your hair out if you can’t get it out until later in the day. Life gets in the way and it’s far more important to send it later then not send it at all.</p><h3 id=\"what-subject-line-should-you-use-for-your-thank-you-note\">What Subject Line Should You Use For Your Thank You Note?</h3><p>Sometimes coming up with a subject line can be the hardest part of writing an email! In this case, you don’t need to go crazy — something short and to the point will do just fine. My recommendations are:</p><ul><li>Thank you for your time today [Name]</li><li>Following up from our interview today</li><li>It was great speaking with you</li><li>Thank you!</li></ul><p>Any of those will do the trick!</p><h3 id=\"finally-proofread-everything-\">Finally, Proofread Everything!</h3><p>Last, but certainly not least, is proofreading every single detail of your thank you email before you send it!</p><p>If you’re writing your thank you note in something like Gmail, I definitely recommend installing a plugin like <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grammarly</a> or <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hemingway</a>. They will catch any spelling errors <em><em>and</em></em> make suggestions for better grammar to help improve your writing.</p><p>Once you have your final draft in front of you, read it out loud! Then send it to a friend to get a double confirmation. If everything looks good after that, you’re all set to send!</p><blockquote><strong><strong>Pro Tip: </strong></strong>To help you save time and mistakes in the future, you can use a tool like RightInbox to create a pre-made <a href=\"https://www.rightinbox.com/blog/how-to-set-up-email-templates-in-gmail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email template</a> out of your message. It’s a huge time saver because you only need to fill in specific fields and don’t have to worry about errors popping up from copy, pasting, and editing.</blockquote><h2 id=\"part-2-post-interview-thank-you-email-templates-examples\"><strong><strong>Part 2: Post-Interview Thank You Email Templates &amp; Examples</strong></strong></h2><p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of great thank you notes, we can dive into the science behind writing one that will stand out from the crowd and get you hired.</p><p>We’ll start by calling out two common thank you email templates that <strong><strong>you should avoid</strong></strong>. These are email templates that everyone ends up using because they’re easy and average. Our goal is to stand out — to zig while everyone else zags — which means we don’t want boring, boilerplate templates.</p><p>Next, I’ll walk you through the methodology behind my thank you email strategy. I’ll show you how to craft an email that will set you apart from the competition and bump you up on the interviewer’s short list. Then you can get a copy of my post-interview thank you email template along with several thank you email examples from real people in my community!</p><h3 id=\"two-common-thank-you-email-templates-to-avoid\">Two Common Thank You Email Templates To Avoid</h3><p>Now that you know why, when, and how to send your thank you email, let’s dive into the science behind crafting an email that helps you build a relationship with your interviewer and stand out from other candidates.</p><p>We’ll start by looking at the mistakes most candidates make when sending their post-interview thank you emails.</p><p>When it comes to thank you’s, the most common formats tend to fall into two buckets:</p><p><strong><strong>Bad Email #1 (Don’t Use This!)</strong></strong></p><blockquote><em><em>Dear Mr. Last Name:</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>I enjoyed speaking with you today about the assistant account executive position at [Company]. </em></em><em><em>The job seems to be an excellent match for my skills and interests.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>In addition to my enthusiasm, I will bring to the position strong writing skills, assertiveness, and the ability to encourage others to work cooperatively with the department.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>I appreciate the time you took to interview me. I am very interested in working for you and look forward to hearing from you regarding this position.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Sincerely,</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Name</em></em></blockquote><p>This email showcases zero personality and is so painfully formal that it can actually come off as unprofessional. You just spent an hour in a room trying to build a relationship with this person, you want your thank you note to be a reflection of your conversation!</p><p>Here’s what the second most common email looks like:</p><p><strong><strong>Bad Email #2 (Don’t Use This Either!)</strong></strong></p><blockquote><em><em>Hi Name,</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I really enjoyed speaking with you about the position and am looking forward to next steps.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Best,</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Your Name</em></em></blockquote><p>While this is far better than Email #1, it leaves a lot on the table. Again, after chatting with someone for an hour, you should have a little bit more to say than <em><em>“thanks, hope to hear from you soon!”</em></em></p><p>Remember, your thank you note is a huge opportunity for you to stand out, continue building a relationship with your interviewer, and cement that positive association in their mind.</p><p>We want to make sure we’re doing everything we possibly can to capitalize on those three things.</p><h2 id=\"a-great-thank-you-note-starts-during-the-interview\"><strong><strong>A Great Thank You Note Starts During The Interview</strong></strong></h2><p>In order to maximize the value we deliver with our thank you note, we need to gather as much information as we possibly can during the interview.</p><p>These details come from the small talk you make before the interview starts, the conversations sparked by your answers or your resume, and <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/5-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the questions you ask your interviewer</a>.</p><p>This is more of an art than a science and truly a case of practice makes perfect. Here are some pointers to get you started:</p><ul><li>There is always a few minutes of small talk before the interview starts – use that to spark up a conversation. For example, if it’s a Monday or Tuesday, ask how their weekend went. If it’s Wednesday – Friday, ask if they have plans for the upcoming weekend.</li><li>If they begin talking, ask follow up questions. The longer you can get them to continue, the more information you get and the higher the odds of them <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/08/why-we-overshare-the-brain-likes-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creating a positive association with you in their brain</a>.</li><li>At the end of the interview, have questions prepared (<a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/5-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a list of my favorites</a>). I always end an interview by asking them about their personal life outside of work.</li></ul><p>The more personal information you get during the interview, the more ammo you have to include in your thank you note.</p><p>Remember the response I quoted in the opening paragraph of this post?</p><p>That VP had asked me about a book I read recently that made an impact on me. As soon as I answered, I asked her the same question. I hadn’t read the book she mentioned, but I was very familiar with the author (Seth Godin).</p><p>I followed that up by asking her what she likes to read (<em><em>“are you a non-fiction only kind of person?”</em></em>) and how she finds the time to read with her crazy schedule.</p><p>Those two follow up questions sparked a conversation that lasted 15 minutes and helped me build a rapport.</p><p>In my thank you note, I mentioned that I ordered the book and appreciated the recommendation. A week later (after reading it), I followed up with her and mentioned my two favorite points the author made.</p><p>The mention in the thank you note helped me land the job and the follow up helped me start my new career with a fan in upper management.</p><h2 id=\"the-most-effective-thank-you-email-template\"><strong><strong>The Most Effective Thank You Email Template</strong></strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, I went on 50+ interviews and spoke to well over 100 people during the course of my job search. That meant a lot of thank you notes and, better yet, a lot of opportunity to test what format works best.</p><p>After all was said and done, the template below is the one my data showed to be most effective. I measured “effectiveness” by the percentage of people who replied as well my success rate for scoring a slot in the next round of interviews (or getting the offer).</p><p>Here’s why it works.</p><p>To start, we lead off with our “thank you.” It sounds dumb, but you’d be surprised at how many people fail to actually include the words “thank you” in their note (seriously, I see this a surprising amount with the people I coach). Instead of actually saying it, they <em><em>imply it </em></em>by saying stuff like “great chatting with you.”</p><p>People are busy, especially as you get further up the food chain. Their time is valuable and it goes a long way to acknowledge that. Don’t just imply it, write out the words!</p><p>Next, we make a point to show them that we listened and understood.</p><p>Full attention is a rare thing in today’s world and people like interviewers expect to get it from you. By recapping a point that you spoke about in your conversation, it shows that you were listening and engaged.</p><p>Bonus points if you add in an action you took based on the conversation, or share a relevant (and quality) piece of content!</p><p>Then, at the end of the email, we do the exact same thing by taking a personal angle in the PS. For best results, mention taking action against advice your interviewer gave you, illustrate your results, and finish with a follow up question.</p><p>This helps solidify your level of engagement in the interviewer’s mind and keeps the door open to continue the conversation and build the relationship.</p><p>Now that you understand why each piece of the thank you email puzzle is important, let’s check out a few examples of what an awesome post-interview thank you email looks like:</p><h3 id=\"my-post-interview-thank-you-email-template-examples\"><strong><strong>My Post-Interview Thank You Email Template &amp;

   \n<p>Writing a cover letter can be one of the most stress inducing aspects of the job search.</p><p>The reason writing them is so difficult is because we don’t have a defined framework to follow.</p><p>If you need to update your resume, you download a template and fill in the blanks. When you’re applying to jobs, the employer lays out the fields you need to complete right there in the application.</p><p>But when you’re writing a cover letter, you probably find yourself staring at a blank Word document wishing the right words would will themselves onto the page.</p><p>Most of us don’t consider ourselves to be the next Walter Isaacson, and the task of crafting the perfect story sits well outside of our comfort zone. It doesn’t help that most of the advice out there on the subject is vague at best.</p><p>I did a quick Google search for “How To Write A Cover Letter.” Here are a few things the “experts” recommend:</p><ul><li><em><em>Assess the employer’s needs and your skills. Then try to match them in the letter in a way that will appeal to the employer’s self-interest.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Arrange the points in a logical sequence; organize each paragraph around a main point.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Basic fonts like Arial, Calibri, </em>Helvetica<em>, Verdana, and </em>Open Sans<em> work well. A font size of 10 or 12 points is easy to read. Standard margins are 1” on the top, bottom, and left and right sides of the page.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Be sure to include positive traits like “Focused,” “Hard Working,” and “Results Oriented”</em></em></li></ul><p>While all of this advice is technically correct, did you feel your confidence skyrocket when you went back to type out that first sentence?</p><p>Yeah, me neither…</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Infographic-Breakdown-of-Writing-A-Cover-Letter-That-Gets-Results.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Infographic - Breakdown of Writing A Cover Letter That Gets Results\" width=\"1700\" height=\"1450\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"writing-a-cover-letter-that-actually-gets-you-hired\"><strong><strong>Writing A Cover Letter That Actually Gets You Hired</strong></strong></h2><p>Here’s the thing – most career “experts” out there give vague advice that they’ve seen work in their corner of the market. It doesn’t get too specific because many career coaches (even recruiters) have never been through the application process at a world class company.

People seem to think that they are the missing link that will suddenly skyrocket the response rates of potential employers.</p><p>When I asked my audience to choose between a guide on cover letters, resumes or LinkedIn profiles, cover letters won out by a significant margin.</p><p>The truth is, in the mind of a recruiter/hiring manager, your cover letter is a tie breaker that is only read after the rest of your application has been reviewed. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2012/06/08/are-we-killing-off-the-cover-letter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">90% of hiring managers</a> don’t even read cover letters. However, over half of employers noted that they prefer candidates who submit a cover letter:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Cover-Letter-Stats.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cover Letter Statistics Infographic\" width=\"2205\" height=\"814\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This leaves us in an interesting place.</p><p>We need to craft a good cover letter to help boost our chances, but we don’t want to spend several hours doing so because there are far better ways to spend our time to get results during the job search. If you follow the <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/how-to-get-a-job-anywhere-no-connections/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">networking and value-add strategies in my other articles</a>, those strategies are going to be far more effective at breaking ties than a 3-5 paragraph document.</p><p>My hope is that this guide will give you a framework that enables you to efficiently craft cover letters that are more likely to get you hired.</p><h3 id=\"the-7-cover-letter-mistakes-that-cost-people-jobs\"><strong><strong>The 7 Cover Letter Mistakes That Cost People Jobs</strong></strong></h3><p>If we want our cover letter to be as effective as possible we need to make sure we avoid the mistakes that employers hate to see, yet most people still make.</p><p>In order to be as accurate as possible, I went out and spoke to recruiters from Google, Microsoft, and a few Wall Street firms on top of my own research. Then I cross referenced that information with the several hundred cover letters that have come across my desk at Cultivated Culture.</p><p>After all was said and done, here are the 7 most common mistakes people make on cover letters that will cause recruiters to throw out their application:</p><h4 id=\"1-typos-grammatical-errors-and-general-sloppiness\"><strong><strong>1. Typos, grammatical errors, and general sloppiness</strong></strong></h4><p>This is the most obvious and most common issue. Over <a href=\"http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=7%2F6%2F2005&amp;id=pr181&amp;ed=12%2F31%2F2005\">70% of recruiters</a> noted that they would automatically toss a cover letter with some type of spelling or grammatical error. The good news is that it’s also the easiest mistake to fix.</p><p>Before you submit your cover letter, make sure it’s reviewed by at least two other parties. You might want to consider hiring a professional editor/proofreader as they’re not too expensive for a short document and they will pick up on things most people would miss. It’s easy enough to find one on <a href=\"http://www.upwork.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Upwork</a>.</p><p>Another trick you can use is including an obvious mistake about 75% of the way through. If you have “catching Justin Beiber’s sweaty t shirt at a concert” sitting in there and someone doesn’t call you out, you know they probably didn’t read it very carefully.</p><h4 id=\"2-going-over-a-single-page\"><strong><strong>2. Going over a single page</strong></strong></h4><p>99% of the resumes and cover letters I receive are over a single page. Funnily enough, 99% of the recruiters I speak to tell me that they absolutely <em><em>hate</em> </em>resumes and cover letters that are more than one page.</p><p>The ideal length for a cover letter is 3-5 paragraphs. Changing the margins, font, and font size are all fair game – just keep things on one page, ok?</p><h4 id=\"3-regurgitating-your-resume-in-a-slightly-different-format\"><strong><strong>3. Regurgitating your resume in a slightly different format</strong></strong></h4><p>Your cover letter is a space for you to truly differentiate yourself. If you’re just taking the bullets on your resume and turning them into full sentences, you’re missing out on a HUGE opportunity.</p><p>Use the cover letter to show a little personality and share something that people wouldn’t know if they just scanned through your resume (more on that in a sec).</p><p>Remember, this is a tie breaker. If your cover letter isn’t holding people’s attention it’s probably going to lose out.</p><h4 id=\"4-focusing-on-training-or-arbitrary-credentials-instead-of-results\"><strong><strong>4. Focusing on training or arbitrary credentials instead of results</strong></strong></h4><p>Many of us feel unqualified for the jobs we want. As a result, we try to twist our experience to match the traditional qualifications for our target role.</p><p>The problem with this approach is that you are competing against people who qualify for the traditional credentials, no matter what role you’re applying for. If you try to beat them at their own game, you’re going to lose 9 times out of 10.</p><p>Am I saying you should forget about trying to spin your experience to position yourself well? Absolutely not. However, adding that business class on your resume when you’re 4-5 years out of college isn’t going to help much.</p><p>Instead, focus your time outside of work on building tangible results that you can showcase in your cover letter (and resume). If you want to be a developer, take a few coding courses and build something cool. If you want to be in digital marketing, land a few clients and run their ads for them.</p><p>Telling a story about how you took proactive steps to build experience in a field will beat traditional credentials in most cases. Companies love to see that you’re hungry to learn.</p><h4 id=\"5-not-addressing-your-cover-letter-to-an-actual-person\"><strong><strong>5. Not addressing your cover letter to an actual person</strong></strong></h4><p>I die a little bit inside when I see cover letters addressed as “Dear Hiring Manager” or “To Whom It May Concern.”</p><p>Anyone who reads that is immediately going to mentally bucket it as impersonal. It’s far better to address your cover letter to an actual human, even if it doesn’t end up in their hands. Here is my strategy.</p><p>Let’s say I’m applying for an Account Manager role at Google:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-01-at-7.46.03-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Writing Effective Cover Letters - Google Account Manager Role Screenshot\" width=\"2014\" height=\"234\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I’m going to head over to LinkedIn and start by working to find the specific person who would manage the role I’m applying for. If I can’t find them, or I’m unsure, then I’ll aim for the most senior person that my target role would fall under.</p><p>The ladder for Account Managers typically follows with Senior Account Manager, Account Director, and VP. I’m going plug in “Account Director” under LinkedIn’s title filter to cover all of the bases there. Then I’m going to add “Google” in the company filter and “Greater New York Area” in the location filter:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-01-at-7.45.35-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Writing Effective Cover Letters - LinkedIn Search Filters For Identifying Contacts\" width=\"658\" height=\"534\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>That search is going to bring up a slew of people that I could address directly in my cover letter:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Account-Directors-Google.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot of Account Directors in LinkedIn Search for Cover Letter\" width=\"738\" height=\"570\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Regardless of who reads your cover letter, they’ll know that you did your research. On top of that, your cover letter might even make it into the hands of the person you addressed it to!</p><h4 id=\"6-failing-to-showcase-any-personality\"><strong><strong>6. Failing to showcase any personality</strong></strong></h4><p>As mentioned earlier, your cover letter is one of the few opportunities for you to truly differentiate yourself from the competition. If you’re applying for jobs online (which I don’t recommend), the only thing you have to sell yourself is your resume, your cover letter, and your application.</p><p>Instead of rehashing the experience on your resume, tell a story about how you got that experience. &nbsp;Make it unique and personable. I had the most success when I talked about how I transitioned from a job in medicine to the tech world by starting a side business generating leads for real estate agents. I’d speak openly about the challenges I faced, the mistakes I made, and why I went through it all in the first place.</p><p>Use this space to tell your story. Remember, people don’t buy what you do – they buy you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA&amp;t=1s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><em>why you do it.</em></em></a></p><h4 id=\"7-writing-about-an-uncomfortable-situation\"><strong><strong>7. Writing about an uncomfortable situation</strong></strong></h4><p>While we’re on the topic of telling stories, there is one thing you want to avoid – talking about something extremely uncomfortable. What might have worked for your college essay isn’t going to work here.</p><p>You want to keep things professional. It’s okay to talk about business-related mistakes and challenges, but try to steer away from deeply personal stories. They are far more likely to hurt than help.</p><p>If your cover letter doesn’t violate any of the rules above, you’re off to a good start!</p><h3 id=\"the-anatomy-of-a-highly-effective-cover-letter\"><strong><strong>The Anatomy Of A Highly Effective Cover Letter</strong></strong></h3><p>When I was job searching, one of the most frustrating things was trying to get a clear picture of what to include in my resume/cover letter/application. There is so much conflicting “expert” advice online it makes you feel like you’re shooting in the dark.</p><p>When I started Cultivated Culture, I began tracking how different factors influenced the success of my students. After working with hundreds of job seekers over the past few years, I’ve found a strong correlation between the following factors and a high rate of successfully landing interviews:</p><h4 id=\"1-capitalize-on-your-cover-letter-s-header\"><strong><strong>1. Capitalize On Your Cover Letter’s Header</strong></strong></h4><p>Most people don’t realize that when they hit “submit” on their app, their cover letter gets scanned by a robot that’s looking for specific words and phrases.</p><p>One of the major keywords the look for is a matching or relevant job title. If you’re applying for a Project Manager role, are you including Project Manager, Project Management, PMP, or something similar in your cover letter? That’s what the robot is looking for and the header is a great place to inject it. I recommend dropping it in right below your name.</p><p>Once you get past the robots, your cover letter is going to end up in the hands of a real human.</p><p>We want to make it as easy as possible for this person to learn more about us and get in contact if they want. I always recommend that you include the following right at the top of your cover letter:</p><p><strong><strong>Email Address </strong></strong>– Make sure it’s simple and professional. 76% of applications are rejected for having unprofessional email addresses. Also, don’t forget to hyperlink it! You want the employer to be able to click and get in touch.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Examples-of-good-and-bad-email-formatting-for-cover-letters.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Examples of good and bad email formatting for cover letters\" width=\"1575\" height=\"678\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><strong><strong>LinkedIn Profile</strong></strong> – <a href=\"https://www.resumego.net/research/linkedin-interview-chances/\">A recent study</a> showed that applications that include a link to a comprehensive LinkedIn profile increase their chances of hearing back by 71%!</p><p><strong><strong>Phone Number </strong></strong>– If they like what they read, make it easy for them to pick up the phone and dial.</p><p><strong><strong>Relevant Links </strong></strong>– Your header is also a great place to share links to things like Github, relevant social profiles, personal websites, your blog, etc.</p><p>Finally, a lot of people ask me about including a location. I don’t recommend adding your location when writing a cover letter unless the application requires it. </p><p>Your address and location are private, personal information and putting them on a resume or cover letter that you're upload across the internet is a major risk. You're putting yourself at the mercy of the company's data practices and, if they don't follow <a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/nonprofit-data-security\">good data security practices</a>, you could end up doing your best Jason Bateman impression chasing down data thieves in Florida.</p><h4 id=\"2-tell-a-story-in-your-opening-paragraph\"><strong><strong>2. Tell A Story In Your Opening Paragraph</strong></strong></h4><p>This is an overarching theme that you want to include in each section of your cover letter.</p><p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/10/why-your-brain-loves-good-storytelling\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Science has proven</a> that people are more likely to remember information (or candidates in this case) when it’s delivered in the form of a story. Stories also help build a positive psychological association with the reader (or recruiter/hiring manger here).</p><p>Remember Dan Brown’s book <em><em>The Da Vinci Code</em></em>?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/da-vinci-code-4.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Da Vinci Code Promo Poster\" width=\"1200\" height=\"737\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>It was a novel about cryptic clues in some of Leonardo da Vinci’s most famous paintings leading to to holy grail. While the book itself is fictitious, the artists, pieces, and much of the history behind them is accurate.</p><p>Now, if you asked most people about their opinion on art history, they’d tell you it was boring. They’d also groan in disappointment if you tried to get them to read a book on the subject. However, Dan Brown’s novel skyrocketed to the top of the New York Times bestseller list and became an international sensation. In fact, it caused applications for art history degrees to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/da-vinci-code-fans-line-up-to-study-art-history-226429.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jump up 25%</a> in the years following its publication.</p><p>Why were all of these people suddenly interested in field previously considered to be “boring?” Because Dan Brown fed historical facts in the context of an interesting story!</p><p>We’re aiming to do the same in our cover letter – specific examples below.</p><h4 id=\"2-talk-about-why-you-re-interested-in-the-company\"><strong><strong>2. Talk About Why You’re Interested In The Company</strong></strong></h4><p>In the first section of your cover letter, you want to briefly talk about why you are interested in the role and the company. Remember, we want to drive the message through a story.</p><p>When I was applying at Google, I wanted to work there because they were a household name that was focused on cutting edge technology, but they also cared about impacting lives. Here is the story I used to drive that point home:</p><blockquote><em><em>I wanted to recount a story from my referral [Name]. He’s in the education vertical and spends a significant amount of time at rural schools. When he was down in South Carolina, a teacher asked him about the possibility of getting wifi for the town and its students. [Name] said he would do his best and upon returning he asked around. He sent an email to Astro Teller who responded and they discussed the feasibility of implementing project Loon in the area. I don’t think it panned out but the fact that the communication took place over a tiny town in South Carolina sold me. That’s the kind of stuff I want to be doing.</em></em></blockquote><p>If you don’t have a story that immediately jumps to mind, the best way to get one is by talking to people who work at the company. Look up the company’s mission or their core values beforehand and ask that person to tell you about the best example they’ve personally experienced.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/email-lookup-guide-find-any-email/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check out this article</a> if you want to know how to find someone’s corporate email address.</p><h4 id=\"3-highlight-what-you-bring-to-the-role\"><strong><strong>3. Highlight What You Bring To The Role</strong></strong></h4><p>The second section of your cover letter should showcase what you’re going to bring to the role by talking about your past achievements. Be sure to use measurable metrics (actual numbers and quantitative results) to support your points.</p><p>If you’re coming from a non-traditional background (and don’t feel like you’re “qualified”) this is the time to address that objection. Here is another excerpt from my Google cover letter that addresses my background using measurable results:</p><blockquote><em><em>You might notice that there isn’t much “traditional” digital experience on my resume. That is because, coming from a scientific background, I needed to take a different path. In an effort to gain experience, I created my own agency called OpenWater Analytics. I specialized in using AdWords to generate real estate leads for private communities. I managed the entire sales process from cold outreach, to closing, to servicing the accounts on your platform.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Most recently, I helped a community in South Carolina sell every listing on their site (about 15 homes) in less than 6 months. Our cost per lead was half of the competition and we did it all for less than the commission the realtor would have made on a single house (including ad spend).</em></em></blockquote><p>When I wrote this, I didn’t have much digital experience to speak to. Rather than trying to spin what I had, I went out and built the experience myself by starting a digital marketing firm. Again, if you feel like your experience is lacking, get out there are create your own!</p><h4 id=\"4-reference-your-value-validation-project\"><strong><strong>4. Reference Your “Value Validation” Project</strong></strong></h4><p>If you’ve read my article on <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/how-to-get-a-job-anywhere-no-connections/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Get A Job Anywhere With No Connections</a>, you know that I always advocate for creating what I like to call a <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/value-validation-project/\">“Value Validation Project.”</a></p><p>This consists of having a conversation with someone at the company you want to work for and identifying their largest challenge or upcoming initiative. You then use that information to research on your own and come up with several solutions/suggestions for your contact.</p><p>In the final section of your cover letter you want to mention this project and include a call to action to discuss it. It could look something like this:</p><blockquote><em><em>In hopes of learning more about [Company], I had a meeting with [Name]. She told me that her team’s largest challenge was upselling customers into the company’s new, complementary platform. She noted that, despite the platform increasing retention and lowering costs for clients, the upfront cost to onboard was a major obstacle.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>In my previous role, we dealt with a similar situation. Our clients were receptive to adopting a new platform despite the data showing that it would be beneficial for all parties. I spearheaded an initiative where we tested and analyzed several revenue models that maximized adoption rates and profit margins. In the end, we increased adoption rates by 30% without impacting revenue.</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>Using the information that [Name] gave me, I outlined the process in detail as it relates to your platform. I believe that your team could implement these strategies immediately and see similar results. If you’d like me to send it to you, please let me know! My email is name@email.com.</em></em></blockquote><p>This section is incredibly powerful because it shows that you are not only interested, you went ahead and proved out the value you could bring to the team. Additionally, the call to action can lead to conversations with the very people who will make the decision to hire you!</p><h2 id=\"cover-letter-templates-steal-the-exact-cover-letter-i-used-at-google-microsoft-twitter\">Cover Letter Templates – Steal The Exact Cover Letter I Used At Google, Microsoft, &amp; Twitter</h2><p>At this point you should have a solid understanding of the science behind writing a killer cover letter. You should also have a good handle on what mistakes to avoid so your cover letter makes an awesome first impression.</p><p>Now we need to apply all of that to ink on paper! In order to make that easy for you, I’m including a copy of the cover letter templates that I used to land an interview at Google so you can see exactly how I wrote it.</p><h4 id=\"context-for-the-template\"><strong><strong>Context For The Template</strong></strong></h4><p>Before we dive into the exact cover letter template, I want to give you some context so you can better understand the content of the letter.</p><p>I was applying for a Digital Advertising Sales Account Manager at Google’s offices in New York. I started by doing some research on LinkedIn to find who I believed to be the hiring manager (her name was Emmy).</p><p>I knew that my non-traditional background was a big red flag for most employers so my goal was to proactively address it in my cover letter by calling it out, talking through what I’d done to build the right skills, and highlight the results I’d achieved from those efforts.</p><p>Finally, I had spoken to several Google employees who all told me that “Googliness” (cultural fit) was a huge factor in the company’s hiring decisions. If I wanted to have a chance, I needed a compelling narrative around why I wanted to work for them and why I was a good fit.</p><p>With all of that in mind, here’s the cover letter I wrote:</p><h3 id=\"austin-s-cover-letter-template\">Austin’s Cover Letter Template</h3><blockquote>Dear Emmy Anlyan,</blockquote><blockquote>I grew up with Google. When I was seven years old, I used to sneak down to my Dad’s office at five in the morning to play video games. I still remember opening the browser and seeing the bright, multi-colored letters above the search box for the first time. I’ve always been interested in the tech space and, while my background has mainly been in the sciences, I’m ready to dive head first into the digital world.</blockquote><blockquote>I believe I would be a great fit for the Digital Advertising Sales Account Manager role because I have a deep understanding of the businesses that partner with Google and how they define success.</blockquote><blockquote>You might notice that there isn’t much “traditional” digital experience on my resume. That is because, coming from a scientific background, I needed to take a different path. In an effort to gain experience, I created my own agency called OpenWater Analytics. I specialized in using AdWords to generate real estate leads for private communities. I managed the entire sales process from cold outreach, to closing, to servicing the accounts on your platform.</blockquote><blockquote>Most recently, I helped a community in South Carolina sell every listing on their site (about 15 homes) in less than 6 months. Our cost per lead was half of the competition and we did it all for less than the commission the realtor would have made on a single house (including ad spend).</blockquote><blockquote>Understanding how these small businesses worked was critical to my success, and I believe those skills will help Google acquire happier, more successful customers who are inclined to spend. In addition, I’ve done some research on your team and have come to understand that your largest challenge is around successfully growing smaller accounts at scale. Based on my experience, I’ve put together a few suggestions below this letter – I’m happy to chat through them in more detail if you’d like.</blockquote><blockquote>I wanted to close with a quick story about Google that solidified my choice to apply. My referral, <strong><strong>[Name of Referral]</strong></strong>, works in the education vertical. He services the southeast and many of his accounts are rural. On his last visit down there, in a South Carolina town of 1,500 with no wifi, a teacher asked him if Google could help bring the internet to them.</blockquote><blockquote>When <strong><strong>[Name of Referral]</strong></strong> made it back to the office, he emailed Astro Teller asking about the potential for Project Loon to help bring this town in the 21st century. To his surprise, Astro wrote him back within the week mentioning that he’d look into it.</blockquote><blockquote>While things didn’t pan out, the fact that director of Google’s moonshot project division wrote back an employee about an elementary school in South Carolina blew me away. That is the kind of work I want to be doing.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for taking the time to read my note, I’m incredibly excited to have the opportunity to be considered for this position.</blockquote><blockquote>Best,<br>Austin</blockquote><h4 id=\"download-a-free-copy-of-austin-s-cover-letter-template\">Download A Free Copy Of Austin’s Cover Letter Template</h4><p>If you want a copy of that cover letter template with the header included and everything formatted, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GhVyqfQEuThUstRE9WIqvEJreEIceAu1N_nsbQIx9Tg/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a link to a copy on my Google Drive.</a></p><p>After you click through the link, just hit File &gt; Make A Copy &gt; Organize to add it to your own Google Drive!

This 8,000+ word guide dives deep into 15 proven LinkedIn profile tips that will show you exactly how to optimize every aspect of your profile and get the results you want:</p><p>More profile views, more connections, more opportunities, and more job offers.</p><h1 id=\"why-am-i-qualified-to-share-linkedin-profile-tips\">Why am I qualified to share LinkedIn profile tips?</h1><p>Good question! People always ask me what my #1 piece of advice is and I tell them this:</p><p><em><em>You should only take advice from people who already have what you want.</em></em></p><p>There are a lot of career “gurus” on the internet slinging LinkedIn profile tips with absolutely no qualifications or evidence to back them up.</p><p>If I were in your shoes, I’d want to know that the advice I was implementing <em><em>had</em> </em><em><em>actually worked in the past</em></em>. My name is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abelcak/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Austin Belcak</a> and here’s my LinkedIn “resume” (a.k.a. why I’m qualified to speak about this):</p><ul><li>I personally used LinkedIn to land job offers at Microsoft, Google, and Twitter</li><li>I’ve coached thousands of job seekers and have helped them land jobs at places like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Deloitte, Sequoia Capital, Space X, and more — all using LinkedIn</li><li>I’ve grown my LinkedIn following from 3,000 people to 20,000 people in just under 5 months</li><li>I average 5,000 LinkedIn profile views every month and over 1,000 people find my profile via LinkedIn search <strong><strong>every week</strong></strong></li><li>My LinkedIn posts average 45,000 views and have accrued over 5,000,000 total views</li></ul><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6527171211863035904\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s one of my posts</a> from two weeks ago which saw over 226,000 views:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-of-recent-LinkedIn-post.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot of recent LinkedIn post\" width=\"979\" height=\"532\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>And here’s a quick snapshot of my LinkedIn profile views for the past 90 days:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-of-Austins-LinkedIn-profile-views.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot of Austins LinkedIn profile views\" width=\"1459\" height=\"684\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you want to learn more, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abelcak/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a link to my profile</a>.

I’m sharing them so you feel confident that the advice you’re about to read will work for you.</p><p>My goal is to walk you through the exact LinkedIn profile tips I used to get those results so you can replicate them for yourself!</p><p>Without further ado, let’s start with some basics:</p><h2 id=\"tip-1-keep-your-linkedin-profile-updates-to-yourself\">Tip #1: Keep your LinkedIn profile updates to yourself</h2><p>Before you begin overhauling your LinkedIn profile, there’s one critical box you need to make sure you’ve checked: profile privacy.</p><p>You don’t want Jane from HR getting suspicious because she saw a LinkedIn notification about the recent profile updates you made.</p><p>Fortunately, LinkedIn lets you to pick and choose who is allowed to see the updates you make to your profile. All you need to do is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/activity-broadcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click this link</a>, or go to: Settings &amp; Privacy &gt; How LinkedIn uses your data &gt; Share job Changes:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-of-LinkedIn-profile-privacy-settings.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot of LinkedIn profile privacy settings\" width=\"1040\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Now you can turn your LinkedIn profile into a job generating machine without tipping off anyone at your current company.</p><h2 id=\"tip-2-let-recruiters-know-you-re-open-for-business\">Tip #2: Let recruiters know you’re open for business</h2><p>One of the most frustrating aspects of being a job seeker is pouring hours into your resume, cover letter, or LinkedIn profile only to get zero responses.</p><p>What’s the point of putting in all this work if no one’s going to see it?</p><p>A few years ago, LinkedIn aimed to fix that by rolling out their Open Candidates feature. Open Candidates lets you tell recruiters you’re open to new opportunities and it lets you set preferences for the types of roles you want to hear about.</p><p>Here are a few of the levers you can pull:</p><p><strong><strong>Leave Recruiters A Note:</strong></strong> When you turn on Open Candidates, LinkedIn lets you leave recruiters a note (up to 500 characters) so you can provide some context around your situation and what you’re looking for next.</p><p><strong><strong>Your Status: </strong></strong>Are you actively searching, passively looking, or not looking but open to the right offer? LinkedIn lets you choose any of the above so recruiters &nbsp;have a sense of where you’re at in your job search.</p><p><strong><strong>Target Roles:</strong></strong> LinkedIn also lets you add the job titles you’re interested in/considering so recruiters can send you more relevant opportunities.</p><p><strong><strong>Location Preferences: </strong></strong>Ready to make a move? Don’t want to move more than 10 feet from your kitchen table? Open Candidates also lets you tell employers where you want your next role to be. You can choose specific cities and you can also let them know you’re interested in remote roles.</p><p><strong><strong>Job Types: </strong></strong>Finally, Open Candidates lets you tell recruiters what types of roles you’re open to. You can choose from Full Time, Part Time, Contract, Internship, Volunteer, or Temporary.</p><p>Once you have all of your preferences setup, the last thing you need to do is make sure you’ve flipped your Open Candidates switch to “On”:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Let-recruiters-find-your-linkedin-profile.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshow showing how to allow recrutiers to find your LinkedIn profile\" width=\"1420\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Awesome! Now that we’ve got the easy stuff out of the way, this is where the fun begins.</p><p>Just because you let recruiters know you’re looking for opportunities, doesn’t mean you can put your LinkedIn profile on cruise control and watch the offers roll in. You’re still competing with 500 million other users for that job offer so you need to do everything possible to stand out.</p><p>The good news is you’re in the right place. The rest of this post is going to walk you through some LinkedIn profile tips that will set you head and shoulders above the competition and help you land more interviews, connect with amazing people, and rapidly accelerate your career.</p><h1 id=\"linkedin-profile-tips-optimizing-from-top-to-bottom\">LinkedIn Profile Tips: Optimizing From Top To Bottom</h1><p>Now that we’ve got the basics out of the way, I’m going to show you how to completely optimize your LinkedIn profile to help you rapidly accelerate the results you’re looking for.</p><p>When I was completely overhauling my profile, I found that it was easiest to start at the top and work my way down. I’m formatting this post to follow that same flow.</p><p>We’ll begin with the very top of your LinkedIn profile page – the URL – and then we’ll work down through your cover photo, profile picture, headline, summary, work experience, skills, recommendations, etc. until we’re covered every single aspect of your profile.</p><h2 id=\"tip-3-use-a-custom-linkedin-profile-url\">Tip #3: Use a custom LinkedIn profile URL</h2><p>When you create your account, LinkedIn generates a random string of numbers to associate with your profile. Instead of “Adam Grant” you’re Profile #35467984.</p><p>Unless you change it, that random number is what appears in your LinkedIn profile URL like this:</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/176048168/</p><p>That’s not too sexy is it. When you’re job searching, your LinkedIn profile url is going to be something you leverage quite a bit.</p><p>You’re going to include it on your resume (because <a href=\"https://www.resumego.net/research/linkedin-interview-chances/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a recent study</a> showed that resumes with a link to a comprehensive LinkedIn profile have a <strong><strong>71% better chance of hearing back</strong></strong> from employers).</p><p>You’re going to give it to people you connect with, and you’re also going to want it to show up when someone Googles your name (your URL plays a role in the SEO of your profile, helping it show up more frequently).</p><p>If your profile link is a random string of numbers instead of your name, it’s going to look terrible on your resume/cover letter, and it’s going to be almost impossible for people to find.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Examples-of-good-and-bad-linkedin-profile-urls.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Examples of good and bad linkedin profile urls\" width=\"1080\" height=\"504\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"how-to-customize-your-linkedin-profile-url\">How to customize your LinkedIn profile URL</h3><p>To good news is that LinkedIn allows you to customize your profile URL. You can do that by going to your profile, clicking <strong><strong>Edit public profile &amp; URL</strong></strong> on the right rail, and then clicking <strong><strong>Edit URL</strong></strong>.</p><p>Ideally, you want to use some combination of your full name. Mine is Austin Belcak so any of these combos would work great:</p><ul><li>linkedin.com/in/austin-belcak</li><li>linkedin.com/in/abelcak</li><li>linkedin.com/in/austinbelcak</li><li>linkedin.com/in/austin-e-belcak (using a middle initial)</li></ul><p>Now hit save!</p><h2 id=\"tip-4-use-a-high-quality-linkedin-profile-picture-that-shows-some-personality\">Tip #4: Use a high quality LinkedIn profile picture that shows some personality</h2><p>When someone clicks on your LinkedIn profile, the first thing they look at is your picture.</p><p>Not so bad, right? Well get this:</p><p>Researchers out of the University of York <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617732388\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">did a study</a> on how head shots impacted the way a person is perceived. Their results might blow you away:</p><p>First, a person only needs a 33 <em><em>millisecond </em></em>glance at your picture to form a first impression that includes evaluations of “trustworthiness, status, and attractiveness.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/2017/10/study-reveals-just-quickly-form-first-impression-50039\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to the study’s lead researcher</a>, “facial impressions are relevant… and they are consequential, for instance, predicting government election results and influencing romantic preferences.”</p><p>But it gets even scarier. That first impression that someone forms from a 33 millisecond glance at your face is pretty sticky. The researchers found that longer viewing times didn’t change the initial impression that was formed.</p><p>This means that anyone viewing your profile — recruiters, hiring managers, potential clients, etc. are all forming a first impression the moment your picture pops up.</p><p>You better make that first impression count.</p><p>That means you need an awesome, high quality LinkedIn profile picture that shows off some of your personality!</p><h3 id=\"how-to-take-the-perfect-linkedin-profile-picture-for-free-\">How to take the perfect LinkedIn profile picture (for free)</h3><p>The good news is that you can get one completely free. All you need is a phone that has some sort of portrait mode (or high quality camera) and a friend:</p><ol><li>Wait for a clear, overcast day or find an area with indirect sunlight (direct sunlight is harsh and will make you squint)</li><li>Find a location with a great background — I personally like cityscapes or something natural like trees, etc.</li><li>Fire up portrait mode on your camera and take at least 10 images (you’ll be glad you went overboard, I promise)</li><li>Using editing software to enhance the colors of the image and adjust it until it looks awesome.</li></ol><p>When you’re ready to upload your new profile picture, keep in mind that LinkedIn has some guidelines:</p><h3 id=\"guidelines-linkedin-profile-picture-size\">Guidelines: LinkedIn Profile Picture Size</h3><ul><li>LinkedIn’s profile picture dimensions are 400 x 400 pixels.</li><li>Your profile picture can be larger than 400×400, but it needs to maintain the square ratio to be accepted.</li><li>The maximum resolution for a LinkedIn profile picture is 7680 pixels wide and 4320 pixels high.</li><li>LinkedIn accepts PNG, JPG, and GIF file types.</li><li>The maximum profile picture file size is 8mb (you can reduce your image size using a site like <a href=\"https://compresspng.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CompressPNG</a> or <a href=\"https://compressjpeg.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CompressJPG</a>)</li></ul><h3 id=\"linkedin-profile-picture-examples-from-real-people-\">LinkedIn Profile Picture Examples (From Real People)</h3><p>I mentioned injecting some personality into your LinkedIn profile picture too. Here are some awesome examples of people who do a great job of that:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Joseph-Bradley-LinkedIn-profile-picture.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of high quality LinkedIn profile picture\" width=\"1578\" height=\"506\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Joseph’s picture is crystal clear and does an awesome job of showing off his personality. He’s not trying to do too much and he’s just being himself. The quality of the image, his smile, and what he’s wearing give off a warm first impression!</p><p>He also did a fantastic job bringing some contrast to his cover photo and the rest of his profile. His face and the pop of red in his shirt grab your attention because they stand out from the black and white themes everywhere else.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-Natalia-LinkedIn-profile-pic.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of LinkedIn profile picture\" width=\"1578\" height=\"538\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Natalia Wiechowski is known for her bright blue branding on LinkedIn. It shows up in her videos, on her website, and even on her face! That’s an immediate attention-grabber and makes you feel like Natalia is someone you want to have a conversation with.</p><p>She also does a great job choosing colors that people associate with happiness, trust, and high energy.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-black-and-white-LinkedIn-profile-picture.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of black and white LinkedIn profile picture\" width=\"1580\" height=\"504\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Going for the black and white filter is a great way to differentiate yourself, just like Jason did here. Notice that his picture is still high resolution and high quality though — you need to get that right before you mess with any filters or add ons.</p><p>This may seem like a lot of info, but it’s totally worth it. To recap, a great LinkedIn profile picture:</p><ol><li>Is high quality and high resolution</li><li>Meets LinkedIn’s profile picture guidelines (is 400×400 pixels and no more than 8mb in size)</li><li>Emphasizes your face (by having a solid color or blurred background)</li><li>Conveys your authentic self – wearing clothes you love, with colors you enjoy, in a place that makes you happy</li><li>Showcases your awesome smile ?</li></ol><h2 id=\"tip-5-the-same-goes-for-your-linkedin-cover-photo\">Tip #5: The same goes for your LinkedIn cover photo</h2><p>Most people know that a great LinkedIn profile picture is a must, but almost <em><em>nobody </em></em>takes advantage of their <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/linkedin-cover-photo/\">LinkedIn cover photo</a>!</p><p>Your cover photo is a fantastic place to show off some of your personality and accomplishments. It’s larger than your profile picture too so it’s likely going to grab more eyeballs and help you tell your story.</p><p>The data also shows that profiles with custom profile pictures and cover photos see 21x more profile views, 9x more connection requests, and 36x more messages than people using defaults!</p><h3 id=\"what-should-you-use-in-your-linkedin-cover-photo\">What Should You Use In Your LinkedIn Cover Photo?</h3><p>Your cover photo creates a great opportunity to share more about you as a human being and as a professional.</p><p>My recommendation is to share something you’re passionate about or use your cover photo as real estate to sell yourself.</p><p>Some examples of sharing your passions include pictures of you:</p><ul><li>Presenting/speaking at an industry event</li><li>Doing volunteer work</li><li>Taking part in a (professionally-kosher) hobby like marathon running, painting, hiking, teaching, etc.</li><li>Spending time with your family (everyone loves a person dedicated to their family)</li><li>Traveling</li></ul><p>If you want to use the space to sell yourself, you’re going to be including some graphic elements so you want to make sure the design is on point.</p><p>I recommend using <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/templates/web-banners/linkedin-banner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canva</a> since they have awesome pre-made templates you can edit for free, like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-of-free-LinkedIn-Cover-Photo-templates-on-Canva.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot of free LinkedIn Cover Photo templates on Canva\" width=\"2302\" height=\"946\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Once you’ve settled on your template, you need to decide what you want to push in your cover photo. I recommend featuring:</p><ul><li>Your elevator pitch and goals in two lines or less</li><li>A link to your personal website, if you have one</li><li>Links to your portfolio, projects you’ve worked on, or your resume</li></ul><p>If you want to take things to the next level, find a way to combine awesome design from Canva with one of the passion images I mentioned above!</p><h3 id=\"linkedin-cover-photo-size-dimensions\">LinkedIn Cover Photo Size &amp; Dimensions</h3><p>When you’re uploading your cover photo, you need to make sure it meets LinkedIn’s criteria so it doesn’t get rejected. Here are LinkedIn’s cover photo guidelines:</p><ul><li>The recommended cover photo size is 1584 x 396</li><li>The maximum cover photo file size is 8 mb</li><li>LinkedIn accepts PNG, JPG, and GIF file types for cover photos</li></ul><p>Outside of the official guidelines, there is another big factor that you’re going to want to consider when designing your cover photo: device type.</p><p>When someone is viewing your LinkedIn profile on desktop, your profile picture appears on the lefthand side and will be laid over that part of your cover photo:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-LinkedIn-profile-desktop-layout.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of LinkedIn profile desktop layout\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>However, when someone looks at your profile on mobile, your profile picture will move to the center and obscure a different part of your cover photo:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-LinkedIn-profile-mobile-layout.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of LinkedIn profile mobile layout\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>See how my face covers up different areas of the cover photo depending on what device someone is using to view my LinkedIn profile?</p><p>Due to that, I purposefully spaced out the publisher logos in my cover photo so that four of them are showing at all times. I also chose to avoid placing text on the left side or middle of the cover photo so it wouldn’t be covered.</p><h3 id=\"linkedin-cover-photo-examples-from-real-people-\">LinkedIn Cover Photo Examples (From Real People)</h3><p>Let’s take a look at some real people who did a fantastic job of incorporating all of the tips mentioned above:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LinkedIn-cover-photo-example.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of great LinkedIn cover photo\" width=\"1586\" height=\"698\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Georgia’s cover photo is <strong><strong>awesome</strong></strong>. It’s unique, it’s well designed, it shows off her beliefs, and it immediately grabs attention with those color pops and bold font.</p><p>She also did a fantastic job lining up the black backgrounds in her profile picture and cover photos to create a seamless aesthetic that’s guaranteed to stand out. This is definitely levels above your average LinkedIn profile, but putting in the effort to create something similar is absolutely worth it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-LinkedIn-cover-photo.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of LinkedIn cover photo\" width=\"1576\" height=\"756\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>At the beginning of this section, I mentioned leveraging cover photos to inject some personality into your profile.

When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.” – David Ogilvy, The “Father” of Advertising</em></em></p><p>That advice is just as relevant to your LinkedIn profile as it is to writing ad copy.</p><p>In today’s job market, 90%+ of recruiters are regularly using LinkedIn to find qualified candidates.</p><p>When a recruiter is looking to fill a roll, they use LinkedIn’s search functionality to find awesome people like you. But what makes your LinkedIn profile show up at the top vs. the millions of other people in a similar field? Think of it like this:</p><p>Let’s say it’s 5pm on Saturday and you don’t feel like cooking. You might head to Google and punch in “best Thai restaurants [your city].”</p><p>Google serves a list of restaurants and you begin scanning through their offerings — their menu, reviews from other people, hours, distance, etc. Then you pick one based on what you liked best.</p><p>LinkedIn search works the same way!</p><p>Instead of searching for Thai food, recruiters are searching for keywords that match the position they’re hiring for.</p><p>For example, if they need a new Project Manager, they may search for: <strong><strong>Project Manager, PMP, ACP</strong></strong>, etc.</p><p>If they need a front end developer, they may search for: <strong><strong>Front End Developer, Web Designer, Web Developer</strong></strong>, etc.</p><p>When they hit “search,” LinkedIn scans profiles for relevant data and serves up the people who have the search criteria in their profile. The more your profile matches the search criteria, the higher you’ll show up.</p><p>Your LinkedIn headline carries a lot of weight in these searches so you need to make sure it’s fully optimized for the search terms that recruiters are using.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-identify-the-keywords-you-need-to-use-in-your-linkedin-headline\">How to identify the keywords you need to use in your LinkedIn headline</h3><p>Here’s a quick strategy you can use to boost your chances to matching with the terms recruiters are using to find candidates for roles you’re interested in:</p><ol><li>Open a new Word/Google doc</li><li>Use <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn jobs</a> to search for roles that match your exact criteria (industry, level of experience, location, etc.)</li><li>For each role that lines up with your interests, copy the job title and paste it into your doc</li><li>Rise and repeat until you have copied at least 30 job titles into your doc</li><li>Now head to <a href=\"http://www.wordclouds.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordClouds.com</a> and click on <strong><strong>Word List</strong></strong>, then <strong><strong>Paste/Type text</strong></strong></li><li>Paste in your 30+ job titles and hit <strong><strong>Apply</strong></strong></li></ol><p>Wordclouds is going to generate a cloud showing which words appear most often across those titles. If you want a more empirical view, you can click on <strong><strong>Word List </strong></strong>again to see the exact frequency for each word.</p><p>The top 3-5 words are the keywords you want to focus on including in your LinkedIn headline.</p><p>Here’s an example I created from 30 job titles I found searching for “Sales” in “New York”:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Exampe-of-using-wordclouds-from-LinkedIn-headline.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of using wordclouds from LinkedIn headline\" width=\"1262\" height=\"1116\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you check out the word list, here are the top 5 by frequency:</p><p><strong><strong>16</strong></strong> Sales<br><strong><strong>5</strong></strong> Executive<br><strong><strong>4</strong></strong> Director<br><strong><strong>3</strong></strong> Account<br><strong><strong>3</strong></strong> Manager</p><p>Now I can go back to the job titles to get context around word order and come up with a headline that includes as many of those keywords as I can fit. In this case, I may go with: <strong><strong>Sales Director / Account Executive</strong></strong>.</p><p>This is just the starting point though. LinkedIn gives you a lot of space to work with in your headline and you want to use as much of it as you can.</p><h4 id=\"linkedin-headline-character-limits\">LinkedIn Headline Character Limits</h4><p>LinkedIn limits you to 120 characters for your professional headline on desktop. If you switch to the LinkedIn mobile app, the character limit increases to 200!</p><p>Once you know what keywords you want to inject, you should use the rest of your headline to sell yourself. This will vary based on your goals, but here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li>Share a quick results-based case study (share accomplishments, metrics, big wins, awards, etc.)</li><li>Share a link to your personal website or online portfolio right there in your headline (e.g. “learn more about how I do it here &gt; CultivatedCulture.com)</li><li>Include high priority skills and proficiencies</li><li>Inject some personality and talk about something you enjoy doing outside of your specific job description</li><li>Include a call to action for people read more (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abelcak/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my profile has this</a>).

Why? Because they always need to be selling themselves (and the best ones can do it concisely).</p><p>But here’s the thing – you’re a CEO whether you know it or not. The CEO of your own career and your own life.

Let that shine through in your LinkedIn headline!</p><h2 id=\"tip-7-identify-the-keywords-recruiters-are-using-to-find-candidates\">Tip #7: Identify the keywords recruiters are using to find candidates</h2><p>Remember my little restaurant analogy from the last tip?</p><p>Headlines definitely carry a lot of weight when it comes to being found in search results, but LinkedIn isn’t stopping there. They scan every section of your profile and the more matches you have, the more frequently you’ll show up and get called.</p><p>LinkedIn is tricky because we can’t create multiple profiles for multiple roles like you can with a resume. You only get one profile and you want it to generate as many opportunities as possible. In order to do that, we need to get a sense of the keyword sets associated with the roles we want.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-identify-the-right-keywords-for-your-linkedin-profile\">How to identify the right keywords for your LinkedIn profile</h3><p>Identifying keywords for your entire profile is a little bit more complex than doing it for your headline.</p><p>If you’re tight on budget and/or don’t mind doing a little bit of leg work yourself, you can definitely use the same Wordclouds trick I mentioned above.</p><p>That said, there are some paid tools out there that will help be <strong>significantly </strong>more efficient here. My two favorites are <a href=\"https://www.jobscan.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jobscan</a> and <a href=\"https://skillsyncer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skillsyncer</a> (I have no affiliation with either and it’s worth noting that they are both paid tools with some free trial options).</p><p>Both of these platforms will digest any job description you upload and give you a detailed breakdown of what keywords you need to target. You can also copy and paste your LinkedIn profile sections to see how well you match up:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JobScan-skill-match-report.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"JobScan skill match report\" width=\"1538\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you scan a few job descriptions for every type of role you’re targeting, these platforms will give you an idea of what keywords you need to prioritize.</p><p>Your job is to make sure they’re naturally woven into each of the LinkedIn profile sections we talk about in the rest of this post.</p><h2 id=\"tip-8-your-linkedin-summary-is-for-selling-not-summarizing\">Tip #8: Your LinkedIn Summary is for selling, not summarizing</h2><p>At this point, you’ve got awesome, eye-catchy images and a killer headline that’s going to hook anyone looking at your LinkedIn profile.</p><p>If they like what they see, the natural next step is to scroll down and check out your summary. This is my favorite profile section because it gives you a ton of creative freedom to pitch yourself!</p><p>It’s your opportunity to give some background, provide context, handle objections, highlight your abilities, and show this person why you are the best option, bar none.</p><p>Lots of people have different opinions and strategies on what to put in here. I’m going to share a simple formula that I saw results with as a job seeker and that I use with most of my clients:</p><h3 id=\"austin-s-linkedin-summary-formula-for-job-seekers\">Austin’s LinkedIn Summary Formula For Job Seekers</h3><p>I personally recommend a three part Summary that consists of:</p><ol><li>An opening statement that summarizes your experience and value while including relevant keywords you identified using tactics from previous sections</li><li>A few “case study” bullets which highlight your biggest accomplishments and completed projects (including <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/resume-action-words\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">measurable metrics/results</a>)</li><li>A final bullet or two speaking to any extra-curricular or cultural initiatives (if relevant)</li><li>A closing statement about what opportunities you get excited about and how to get in touch with you (make sure to include an email address where people can reach you!)</li></ol><p>The final bullet is your way of saying “if this type of opportunity were to magically pop up, it would be the type of thing I get <em><em>very excited about </em></em>(wink wink, nudge nudge)” so recruiters can take the hint without raising suspicion at your current job.</p><p>LinkedIn gives you a 2,000 character limit for your Summary section so you want to make sure you use as much of it as you can (without sacrificing quality).</p><h3 id=\"example-of-a-good-linkedin-summary\">Example of a Good LinkedIn Summary</h3><p>I’ll kick off this section by writing out the summary I’d use if I updated my profile for a new job search. I’m currently a Director of Partner Development at Microsoft so let’s say I was targeting Partner Manager / Partner Director roles:</p><blockquote><strong><strong>Austin’s LinkedIn Summary Example</strong></strong></blockquote><blockquote>Director of Partner Development/Management with 7+ years experience building C level relationships, driving scaled growth across a $20M+ book, and consistently exceeding quota.</blockquote><blockquote>+ Spearhead growth of $20M+ book of channel partners, including the two largest revenue generating partners in Microsoft’s global book of business</blockquote><blockquote>+ Maintained 120% average quota attainment and won Microsoft’s Platinum club sales award given to top 300 salespeople across the company</blockquote><blockquote>+ Prospected, negotiated incentive terms, and on-boarded 10 net new channel partners worth $15M+ in annual revenue</blockquote><blockquote>+ Published in Forbes, Business Insider, Fast Company, Inc. and more for opinions and thoughts on hiring and career development</blockquote><blockquote>+ Founder of Career site CultivatedCulture.com, home to 30,000+ job seekers who have gone on to land jobs at places like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, and more without applying online</blockquote><blockquote>“Austin is an absolute pleasure to work with. He provides a level of service we don’t get from other partners and our relationship with him and Microsoft has been a major factor in our growth and eventual acquisition.” – [Client Name, Company]</blockquote><blockquote>I get excited about opportunities to create mutually beneficial partnerships that drive growth on both sides of the relationship, specifically in the world of tech/digital. Want to connect? Feel free to email me at austin@cultivatedculture.com.</blockquote><p>That summary packs in a bunch of keywords that recruiters will be searching for when they’re on the hunt for a new Partner Director/Manager.</p><p>It immediately speaks to my level of experience and the results I drive, notice how almost every bullet has a number in it relating to the results my actions drove.</p><p>I also included a “testimonial” from one of my clients. If you have the opportunity to do this, it is <strong><strong>solid job search GOLD.</strong></strong> The more the merrier, these are basically references that add immediate credibility.</p><p>Finally, it clearly states what opportunities I’m excited about (i.e. would be open to) and gives people an easy way to get in touch via email!</p><h2 id=\"tip-9-take-advantage-of-the-ability-to-include-outbound-links-and-media\">Tip #9: Take advantage of the ability to include outbound links and media</h2><p>One of LinkedIn’s largest advantages is the ability to add links and media to your profile!</p><p>I hear the same thing from so many job seekers, <em><em>“I don’t feel like anyone is seeing or understanding my value.” &nbsp;</em></em>The sentiment in today’s job market is <em><em>don’t tell me, show me.</em></em> Adding links to mentions, accomplishments, projects, articles, and case studies is exactly how you do that.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-add-links-and-media-to-your-linkedin-summary\">How to add links and media to your LinkedIn summary</h3><p>If you head to your own LinkedIn profile, you should see a little pencil icon all the way on the right hand side, just below your cover photo. Clicking that will open up your Summary settings and allow you to edit content and add links:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/How-to-edit-your-LinkedIn-summary.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot showing LinkedIn summary edit button\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Once you’re on the edit screen, scroll down to the bottom and look for the Media section (the last section on the page):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/How-to-add-links-and-media-to-your-LinkedIn-profile.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"How to add links and media to your LinkedIn profile\" width=\"1414\" height=\"596\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This is where you can add in media that will appear right below your summary near the top of your LinkedIn profile (meaning more people are going to see it!).</p><p>You’ll notice that LinkedIn gives you two options for adding media: <strong><strong>Uploading</strong></strong>and <strong><strong>Link</strong></strong>.</p><p>Upload lets you add a document or file you have saved on your computer. For example, did you put together a deck that walked through a complete onboarding process overhaul? You can upload it! Have a 5 page competitive analysis template you’ve been using to close business? Drop it in!</p><p>Anything you can’t link to can be uploaded here, as long as it fits one of the following file types:</p><p><strong><strong>Accepted File Types For LinkedIn Media Uploads</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Adobe PDF (.pdf)</li><li>Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt/.pps/.pptx/.ppsx/.pot/.potx</li><li>Microsoft Word (.doc/.docx/.rtf)</li><li>OpenOffice Presentation Document (.odp)</li><li>OpenOffice Documents (.odt)</li><li>Most .txt files</li><li>.jpg/.jpeg</li><li>.png</li><li>.bmp</li><li>.gif – this doesn’t support animation, however the first frame will be extracted</li><li>.tiff</li></ul><p>Your other option for adding media is linking out.</p><p>This is a fantastic option for personal sites, articles you’ve written, media you’ve been featured in (podcasts, articles, videos, etc.), industry specific profiles (like Github), etc.</p><p>LinkedIn will showcase up to five pieces of media in your summary so you want to make them count! Adding in more will create a sixth thumbnail with a counter showing how many additional pieces of content are available to check out.</p><p>Here’s what that looks like on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexoeducative/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my buddy Alex’s profile</a>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-of-media-and-links-added-to-LinkedIn-profile-summary.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot of media and links added to LinkedIn profile summary\" width=\"1576\" height=\"1236\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In this case, you want to go for quality over quantity.

The bullets your in your LinkedIn profile are aimed at doing one thing: <strong><strong>Selling</strong></strong> <strong><strong>Yourself!</strong></strong></p><p>The good news for us is that people have spent more than a century studying how the written word affects our behavior and tendencies. That field of study is called copywriting and if you’re ever bought a product or signed up for an email list after reading an ad or blog post, you’ve experienced it first hand.</p><p>As we’ve gotten more advanced, people have kept more data on what works best. &nbsp;Marketers at places like <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-the-best-headlines-that-will-increase-traffic/#word-balance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoSchedule</a>, <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-step-by-step-guide-to-writing-powerful-headlines/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neil Patel</a>, and <a href=\"https://buzzsumo.com/blog/most-shared-headlines-study/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buzz Sumo</a> have combed through hundreds of millions of data points to discovery exactly what language, format, and tactics lead to the most catchy copy (leading to more traffic and more money).</p><p>The great news for you is that the science behind catching someone’s attention doesn’t just apply to marketers, it works just as well for LinekdIn bullets too!</p><p>I took all of the research-backed principles that marketers are using to generate clicks and I applied them to LinkedIn bullets and resumes. I kept data on how those performed vs. our original copy, then I distilled everything down into the formula that got the best results:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-anatomy-of-a-highly-effective-LinkedIn-bullet.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The anatomy of a highly effective LinkedIn bullet\" width=\"1474\" height=\"983\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Each role in your Work Experience section should have bullets of your responsibilities, your accomplishments, and the experience you gained. They should all be written using the word mix from the graphic above!</p><p><strong><strong>LinkedIn Pro Tip:</strong></strong> You can also add links and media to individual roles within your Work Experience section. Use the same steps I mentioned in tip #9 to add relevant projects, awards, case studies, and accomplishments that will appear under each role. This is a great way to showcase the material beyond the five you included with your summary.</p><p>Finally, make sure to include <em><em>all </em></em>of your experience on your LinkedIn profile. Profiles that list more than one position<strong><strong> get 29x more views!</strong></strong></p><h2 id=\"tip-11-leverage-the-linkedin-s-skills-section-to-increase-your-credibility-and-show-up-more-often\">Tip #11: Leverage the LinkedIn’s Skills section to increase your credibility and show up more often</h2><p>The Skills section is one of the best bang-for-your-buck investments you can make in your LinkedIn profile.</p><p>First, the skills you add play into the searchability of your profile. Those skills act as keywords and will help you show up at the top of search results. <strong><strong>Profiles with 5+ skills see 17x more profile views</strong></strong> than people with less than five:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-LinkedIn-profile-skills-section.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of LinkedIn profile skills section\" width=\"1528\" height=\"736\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Second, skills are great social proof that will help give you an edge when employers are making a decision about reaching out.</p><p>If an employer is looking for a Project Manager who has a lot of experience with Agile, your profile is an immediate fit if you have 30+ recommendations for Agile from other people who are skilled with the framework. That boosts your chances of hearing back!</p><h3 id=\"how-many-skills-can-you-add-to-your-linkedin-profile\">How many skills can you add to your LinkedIn profile?</h3><p>LinkedIn lets you add up to 50 skills on your profile. That’s 50 opportunities to include keywords and skills that will help you show up in search results and land more job opportunities! You should use as many of them as you can.</p><h3 id=\"what-skills-should-you-add-to-your-profile\">What skills should you add to your profile?</h3><p>It may seem simple, but we want to be smart about the skills that we add to our LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Sure, we want to include skills we’re definitely good at but we also want to include skills/keywords that employers are using to find candidates.</p><p>Remember that Jobscan tool I mentioned back in Tip #7? We’re going to use that again here:</p><ol><li>Find at least 10 job descriptions for roles that you would be interested in</li><li>Go to Jobscan.co and run a scan on each description to see what skills appear most frequently</li><li>After each scan, add the skills to an Excel sheet – have the skills in one column and the number of times they appear in the second</li><li>Rise and repeat for every job description, making sure you update the skills in your sheet</li><li>When you’re done, filter your Excel sheet by “largest to smallest” to see which skills appeared most frequently — these are the ones you want to prioritize for your profile!</li></ol><h3 id=\"how-to-get-endorsements-for-your-skills\">How to get endorsements for your skills</h3><p>Great! Now you’ve got some skills added to your profile, but that doesn’t mean much without any endorsements behind them.</p><p>Highly endorsed skills carry more weight with LinkedIn searches and they also carry more social proof with people who are viewing your profile — people with 5+ relevant skills <strong><strong>get 31x more messages.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 1 – Friends &amp; Family</strong></strong></p><p>The first, and most obvious way to get endorsements is to ask your friends and family. This is actually way more helpful than it seems because you can pick and choose which skills they endorse!</p><p>Nobody is going to be willing to spend an hour endorsing 50 skills (unless you have amazing friends) so pick and choose which 5-10 you want them to endorse. I’d recommend leveraging that Excel sheet you put together and focusing on the 5-10 skills that appear most frequently across job descriptions.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2 – Endorse other people’s skills</strong></strong></p><p>Reciprocity is a strong psychological principle. If you go out there and endorse other people for their skills, you’re likely to get an endorsement in return!</p><p>I’d recommend starting with current and former colleagues. It’s easy to make those endorsements because you’ve worked with them, plus it will help strengthen those relationships.</p><p>When you’re done endorsing, send them a note that says something like this:</p><p><strong><strong>Post-Endorsement Message</strong></strong></p><blockquote>Hey [Name],</blockquote><blockquote>Hope you’re doing well! I just wanted to recognize you for some of the awesome work we’ve done together so I endorsed you for some skills on LinkedIn. If there’s anything else I can do to help, just let me know.</blockquote><blockquote>Best,</blockquote><blockquote>[Your Name]</blockquote><p>Note that I didn’t ask them to endorse my skills in that note. That kind of ruins the magic. If you do this enough, plenty of people will take the hint and return the favor.</p><h2 id=\"tip-12-linkedin-recommendations-are-job-search-gold-put-in-the-time-to-build-them\">Tip #12: LinkedIn Recommendations are job search gold, put in the time to build them</h2><p>When was the last time you made a big purchase?</p><p>What did you do before you pulled the trigger? You probably did a bunch of research, watched some videos, and…<em><em>you read reviews.</em></em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.prdaily.com/report-83-percent-say-word-of-mouth-influences-their-purchases/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research shows</a> that word of mouth recommendations influence the decision for 83% of purchases we make. Things aren’t much different when it comes to your LinkedIn profile!</p><p>Recommendations are one of the most powerful selling tools available to you. They’re like references that employers can read <em><em>before </em></em>they talk to you. If your experience looks good and you’re heavily recommended by a range of people you’ve worked with, chances are good you’re going to get more calls.</p><p>The good news is that most people don’t seek them out. They think it’s weird to ask for Recommendations and they aren’t sure about the guidance they should offer when they do ask. This means most people never get them, which is a <strong><strong>huge </strong></strong>opportunity for you if you’re willing to put in the work.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-get-people-to-give-you-recommendations-on-linkedin\">How to get people to give you Recommendations on LinkedIn</h3><p>Following suit with the recommendations for Skills, the best place to start is with people you know.</p><p>Friends and work-buddies (colleagues or former colleagues you’re close with) are the best place to start. They don’t have the same last name so you won’t lose credibility and, if they’re former colleagues, they’ll carry weight because they worked alongside of you.</p><p>You can also boost your chances by giving them a template to use. It’s much easier for people to fill in the blanks than it is for them to come up with something from scratch:</p><p><strong><strong>LinkedIn Recommendation Template</strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong><strong>[Descriptive Phrase]</strong></strong> is the what comes to mind when I think about <strong><strong>[Your Name]</strong></strong>. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing <strong><strong>[Your Name]</strong></strong> for <strong><strong>[Length of Time]</strong></strong>, during which <strong><strong>[Description of Working Relationship]</strong></strong>.

You only need to care about the last one.</p><p>Why? Because All Star profiles are <strong><strong>40x more likely to be contacted about job opportunities</strong></strong> than any other profile level and they are <strong><strong>18x more likely to show up in search results.</strong></strong></p><p>The good news for you is that only 51% of LinkedIn users have fully completed profiles so this is an incredibly easy way to stand out. Here’s everything you need to do to qualify for All Star status:</p><p><strong><strong>How To Get LinkedIn All Star Status</strong></strong></p><ol><li>Add a high quality LinkedIn profile picture</li><li>Use a custom LinkedIn URL (with some variation of first &amp; last name)</li><li>Add an up-to-date Industry &amp; Location</li><li>Customize your headline with relevant experience &amp; keywords</li><li>Fill out your LinkedIn Summary</li><li>Add at least three positions (current + two previous) to your Work Experience section</li><li>Add your Education to your profile</li><li>Add at least 5 skills to your profile</li><li>Connect with 50+ people</li></ol><p>If your profile meets those criteria, you’ll hit All Star status and significantly improve your visibility on the platform.</p><h2 id=\"tip-14-the-best-way-to-exponentially-increase-your-profile-visibility-on-linkedin-be-an-active-contributor-\">Tip #14: The best way to exponentially increase your profile visibility on LinkedIn? Be an active contributor.</h2><p>Earlier in this post I shared a screenshot of my LinkedIn profile views, which came in around 14,500 for the past 90 days.</p><p>The vast majority of those views didn’t come from searches and profile optimization, they came from people seeing my comments and posts.</p><p>Optimizing your LinkedIn profile for keywords and searches is a must, but the easiest way to accelerate your visibility on LinkedIn is by engaging with the community.</p><p>If you’re only relying on searches and keywords, your presence is going to be limited and the competition is high. There are a finite number of slots on the first page of search results and the chances that your profile shows up as #1 vs. the 250 million other active users is low.</p><p>However, of that same user base, <a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/linkedin-statistics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">only 1.2%</a> create content (posts, comments, etc.) weekly. Recruiters and employers spend a lot of time on LinkedIn, you’re much more likely to catch their attention by showing up as a comment or post in their feed than by crossing your fingers and hoping you show up in a search result.</p><p>Creating content doesn’t have to be hard either. You can do it in less than 10 minutes per day.</p><h3 id=\"the-10-minute-linkedin-content-strategy-that-will-get-you-more-views\">The 10 minute LinkedIn content strategy that will get you more views</h3><p>If you’ve never thought about creating content on LinkedIn, getting started can feel overwhelming but it’s actually much easier than you think.</p><p>Here’s a quick process you can use to create content that will get you WAY more profile views in less than 10 minutes per day:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Follow The Views</strong></strong></p><p>If you want more visibility but don’t have a huge following, you need to go where the views are.</p><p>I’ll bet you’ve seen those posts from people in your industry with a couple hundred likes and comments. Those posts are racking up tens of thousands of views which means any comments left on them are getting in front of those eyeballs too.</p><p>Check out Devin’s post here:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-LinkedIn-post-with-traction-and-engagement.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of LinkedIn post with traction and engagement\" width=\"1090\" height=\"896\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>It has 377 reactions, <strong><strong>but only 18 comments!</strong></strong> This is a huge opportunity to get visibility because this post probably has at least 15,000 views (likely a low-ball estimate) but it doesn’t have a ton of comments which means yours is much more likely to stand out.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Leave A Thoughtful Comment</strong></strong></p><p>The comments section on LinkedIn works like a voting board — the comments with the most reactions, replies, and engagement typically bubble up to the top.</p><p>If you’re the top comment on a post with 20,000 views, you can bet your comment is going to get a decent number of those eyeballs!</p><p>Fortunately for us, most people leave fairly low effort comments on posts. Stuff like, “awesome tips,” “love this advice,” “thanks for sharing,” etc. While those are all great, they’re probably not going to make their way to the top.</p><p>Taking a few minutes to draft up a thoughtful comment that asks a question, shares additional advice, sparks debate, or adds to the discussion is far more likely to generate likes and replies.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Combine For Best Results</strong></strong></p><p>All you need to do to begin generating more profile views is combine the two ingredients above and make it a daily habit.</p><p>Open up LinkedIn a few times throughout the day and scroll through your feed until you find a post that’s gaining traction.</p><p>Once you find one, read it a few times and brainstorm a thoughtful comment that adds to the conversation, then post it.</p><p>This shouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes to do and if you rinse and repeat every day, your profile view count will shoot through the roof!</p><p><strong><strong>Pro Tip: </strong></strong>The earlier you comment on a post that eventually gains traction, the better. Influencers with big followings on LinkedIn are pretty much guaranteed to have large view counts on their posts so all you need to do are follow them, figure out their posts times, and show up early!</p><h2 id=\"tip-15-how-to-find-anyone-s-email-address-using-the-info-from-their-linkedin-profile\">Tip #15: How to find anyone’s email address using the info from their LinkedIn profile</h2><p>If you had to boil down LinkedIn’s ethos to a single word, it would be “connection.”</p><p>While it’s awesome to connect with people on the platform, you’re going to want to take some of these conversations offline. Getting on the phone or meeting in person is where the real magic happens and the real relationships are built.</p><p>LinkedIn is growing, but email is still the most common method of communication in the professional world and my data shows that email still leads to better response rates.</p><p>But in order to email someone, you need their address. Here’s how to find it:</p><ol><li>Take note of the person’s full name (first and last)</li><li>Find a link their company’s homepage (e.g. Microsoft would be www.microsoft.com)</li><li>Go to <a href=\"http://www.hunter.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hunter.io</a></li><li>Under the Product tab go to Email Finder</li><li>Enter your contact’s full name and their company URL, then hit search!</li></ol><p>Hunter should give you their professional email address along with a confidence score.

Facebook, Amazon, &amp; more.</h4><p>Phone interviews are stressful!</p><p>You’ve put in all that time behind your computer tweaking your resume, editing your cover letter, and crafting the perfect application questions. You weren’t expecting much, but then…</p><p>*DING*</p><p>A new email hits your inbox from a recruiter - they want to hop on the phone with you <strong>tomorrow</strong> to see if you’re a good fit for the role and the team.</p><p>Things just got real, this is your chance!</p><p>Now you just have to find a way to stay cool, convey your value, and stand out from the dozens of other people who also landed the phone call. No pressure, right? It’s just your dream job…</p><p>That’s where this post comes in.</p><p>During my job search, I went on over 50 interviews at places like Google, Microsoft, and Twitter. I’ve also coached thousands of job seekers through their interview process here at Cultivated Culture. I used those opportunities to test different strategies with one goal in mind: to find the tactics that will significantly boost your chances of landing the job offer.</p><p>This article distills the 14 most effective phone interview tips I’ve found during that time. To keep things organized, I broke them down into three sections:</p><ul><li><strong>7 Tips To Help Prepare For Your Phone Interview</strong></li><li><strong>What To Do 20 Minutes Before Your Call (5 Tips)</strong></li><li><strong>2 Post-Interview Tips That Will Seal The Deal</strong></li></ul><p>If you follow the framework laid out in this post before your next phone interview, I guarantee you’ll land a spot in the next round:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/NfhjnM6KaPGFWG1LhAf6TtAvv4-bVxBpjeBY\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"NfhjnM6KaPGFWG1LhAf6TtAvv4-bVxBpjeBY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"7-tips-to-help-prepare-for-your-phone-interview\">7 Tips To Help Prepare For Your Phone Interview</h3><p>When it comes to interviewing, 80% of success lies in the preparation. Most job seekers know that it’s important to prepare, but they have no idea <em>how </em>to prepare.</p><p>In this section, I’m going to walk you through six interview prep tips that helped me triple the amount of job offers I received from phone interviews (at places like Google, Microsoft, &amp; Twitter no less!).</p><h4 id=\"tip-1-prepare-memorize-answers-to-common-interview-questions\">Tip #1: Prepare &amp; Memorize Answers To Common Interview Questions</h4><p>The easiest and most efficient way to become a better interviewer is to prepare for the obvious questions.</p><p>If you’ve been on multiple interviews, you’ve probably realized that many of the questions sound familiar. That’s because most interviews are like a Taco Bell menu: the ingredients are the same, everything’s just packaged differently. ?</p><p>One company might ask you about a time you failed while another might ask you about the most valuable lesson you learned at your last job. Both of those questions are essentially getting at the same thing, which means we can handle them with a single answer.</p><p>Between the 50+ interviews I sat through during my job search, the interviews I hear about from the 12,000+ people in the Cultivated Culture community, and the treasure trove of data on places like Glassdoor, I’ve been able to uncover the data behind the questions companies ask, and how often they appear.</p><p>It turns out that most interviews ask a variation of the same set of questions, with one or two wildcards thrown in for good measure. If we boil it down, 95% of interviews mainly consist of these seven questions:</p><blockquote><strong><em>7 Core Phone Interview Questions</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote>Why do you want to work for us?</blockquote><blockquote>Tell me about a time you exhibited leadership</blockquote><blockquote>Tell me about a time where you had to work as a team</blockquote><blockquote>Tell me about a time you’ve had to work with a difficult person, or difficult people</blockquote><blockquote>Tell me about a time you failed</blockquote><blockquote>Tell me about a time you overcame an obstacle</blockquote><blockquote>Tell me about a time when you had success</blockquote><p>If you can prepare and memorize answers to those question, you can walk into almost any interview and succeed with no other preparation! You can do that by:</p><ol><li>Opening a Google Doc and writing down the first thing that comes to mind for each question</li><li>Have a beer or a glass of wine and get a good night’s sleep</li><li>Wake up in the morning, read through your answers, and make edits</li><li>Rehearse your answers at least two more times that day (for a total of 3)</li><li>Rinse and repeat steps 2–5 for seven consecutive days</li></ol><p>For a detail breakdown of crafting great interview answers and a science-based “hack” to help you memorize them with minimal effort, <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/interview-preparation/\" rel=\"noopener\">check out this post.</a></p><h4 id=\"tip-2-record-yourself-answering-each-question\">Tip #2: Record Yourself Answering Each Question</h4><p>Dr. Albert Mehrabian is a professor of psychology at UCLA who specializes in the way people communicate. <a href=\"http://www.nonverbalgroup.com/2011/08/how-much-of-communication-is-really-nonverbal\" rel=\"noopener\">According to his research</a>, 7 % of our message is conveyed through words, 38% through vocal elements, and 55% through nonverbal elements (facial expressions, gestures, posture, etc).</p><p>Crazy, right?</p><p>Phone interviews cut out 55% of the feedback our interviewers would normally use to absorb our message. That means you need to make the other 45% count if we want to make a positive impression that lasts.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/tJHPLdYz72Ix-sOTMlL6ddyDipJiEnABJBvX\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"tJHPLdYz72Ix-sOTMlL6ddyDipJiEnABJBvX\" width=\"800\" height=\"467\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>After you’ve memorized your answers, record yourself delivering them (you can use QuickTime on a Mac or the Voice Recorder app on Windows). Then listen back to your answers and analyze how they came across:</p><ul><li>Do you sound confident?</li><li>Are you rambling or stumbling over your words?</li><li>Are “like,” “um,” or “uhhh” popping up every three words?</li><li>Are you putting enough emphasis on the main points you want to get across?</li></ul><p>By recording your answers and listening back, you’ll hear exactly what the interviewer is going to hear so you can make sure you answers are clear, refined, and convey your message.</p><h4 id=\"tip-3-research-the-company-especially-challenges-new-initiatives\">Tip #3: Research The Company, Especially Challenges &amp; New Initiatives</h4><p>When you’re in the phone interview stage, efficiency is key. You’ll probably be hearing back from several companies at once, all expecting you to show up prepared for a phone interview 24 - 48 hours later.</p><p>When your window is that short, you don’t have time to read and absorb an entire company’s history. Instead, you should be focusing on the pieces of information that matter: the current company status, challenges they’re facing, and upcoming initiatives.</p><p>Here is a simple two step framework that will help you quickly absorb all of that info in less than an hour per company:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Listen To Their Most Recent Earnings</strong> <strong>Call</strong></p><p>Public companies have a responsibility to keep their shareholders up to date on earnings, challenges, and initiatives.</p><p>They do this by holding “earnings calls” or “shareholder meetings” at a regular cadence, usually once per quarter. The great news for us is that the companies record these meetings and share them publicly on their Investor Relations page so anyone can get in on the action. A quick Google search for <strong>[Company Name] Investor Relations </strong>or <strong>[Company Name] Earnings Call </strong>should get you what you’re looking for:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/QDk0Y9zsanGXFwMMKp0lSWsvzZyKKJOBW5d-\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"QDk0Y9zsanGXFwMMKp0lSWsvzZyKKJOBW5d-\" width=\"800\" height=\"279\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Using <a href=\"https://squareup.com/about/investors\" rel=\"noopener\">Square’s Investor Relations page</a> as an example, you’ll find an audio recording of their quarterly earnings call as well as a letter to the shareholders summarizing their performance:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/64bWgCRssJrnc9GJiwlhGFRu-rny34SPxnh9\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"64bWgCRssJrnc9GJiwlhGFRu-rny34SPxnh9\" width=\"800\" height=\"267\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Their average call was around 50 minutes, but if you download the MP3, stick it into iTunes, and run it at 2x speed you’ll be able to get through it in 25 - 30 minutes. That will give you an overview of why the company was successful (or not) over the previous quarter as well as how they’re addressing major challenges and what they’re planning to release in the near future.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Read Trending Articles On Seeking Alpha</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Seeking Alpha</a> is a financial blog and analysis platform where experts from all different companies and philosophies come to share their insight on publicly traded companies.</p><p>I love this site because those analysts do all of the research for you and then distill it down into a quick read so you can suck up all the information without investing (pun intended) a ton of your time. All you need to do is search for your target company and their “profile” page will pop up with their current stock price, major news, and analysis:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/4Rplz4y4TZiGp6ajZvplsPbdOvg7fqSU9sey\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"4Rplz4y4TZiGp6ajZvplsPbdOvg7fqSU9sey\" width=\"800\" height=\"536\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Reading the top five articles from both the News and Analysis section will give you a very solid idea of what the company is currently dealing with and how the short term future looks. If you have a few days before your interview, you can hit the <strong>Get Alerts </strong>button in the upper right hand corner and have a daily digest of the best articles sent to your email every morning. No need to seek out the info, it’ll be delivered straight to you!</p><p>If you spend an hour of your time listening to the company’s most recent earnings call and reading the top articles on Seeking Alpha, you should have all the info you need to make a great impression in your phone interview!</p><h4 id=\"tip-4-research-your-interviewer\">Tip #4: Research Your Interviewer</h4><p>Now that you’ve got a solid handle on the company, it’s time to take a deep dive into the person who’s going to make or break your ability to work for them.</p><p>People tend to have a mental blocker around building relationships. Invisible scripts like “I’m not qualified”, “I get anxious talk to people and I can’t be myself”, “I don’t have anything to offer” prevent us from living up to our potential. The truth is, relationship building during interviews is actually pretty easy to do if you come prepared.</p><p>The person sitting across the table from you <em>wants </em>to like you. If you’re a great fit and a cool person, their job is SO much easier. I’m about to share the secret to building a positive relationship with your interviewer in 5 minutes.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>First, dig up as much information as you possibly can. Here’s my 5 step checklist for learning everything you can about your interviewer in 15 minutes:</p><blockquote><strong><em>15 Minute Research Checklist</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote>+ Read through their LinkedIn profile and check to see if they have any recent posts or shares. If so, read those too.</blockquote><blockquote>+ Check their Twitter profile and browse through the last few weeks of tweets.</blockquote><blockquote>+ Hit up their Facebook profile / Instagram and check out the pictures from the last few weeks.</blockquote><blockquote>+ Google their name and see what comes up - have they been mentioned anywhere? Have they written any articles? Do they have a personal website?</blockquote><blockquote>+ If they have a personal website, browse through that too</blockquote><p>Those steps should give you an idea of who they are as a professional, what their career path looks like, and what their personal interests are.</p><p>For example, if you were interviewing at Microsoft for a Program Manager role, you might be interviewing with my colleague Dare. A quick Google shows us that he’s passionate about politics, as well as the impact tech has on our government and society (it also shows that Twitter might be a great place to connect since he’s so active there):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/dkXRQUGfuaca0hlhRYn78Tp5HSfsRQSiLnqA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"dkXRQUGfuaca0hlhRYn78Tp5HSfsRQSiLnqA\" width=\"800\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Scrolling down the results, we’d also see that Dare shares a lot of his thoughts on his Medium profile. Reading up on some of these posts is a great way to get inside of his head and understand where he’s coming from:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/yaPsEgRdAhK9-mP2NfLMpV3TXt2pCpVCinbm\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"yaPsEgRdAhK9-mP2NfLMpV3TXt2pCpVCinbm\" width=\"800\" height=\"865\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>These are great angles you can use to make small talk, bring down the “professional barrier”, and build a rapport with your interviewer. Even if you’re not “good” or comfortable with small talk, all you need to do is back the conversation into the topic, ask them about it, and continue with follow up questions!</p><h4 id=\"tip-5-create-a-list-of-questions-to-ask-your-interviewer\">Tip #5: Create A List Of Questions To Ask Your Interviewer</h4><p>Asking questions is one of the most important and underutilized parts of the interview.</p><p>Leading up to the Q&amp;A, your interviewer has been controlling the conversation, and they’ve likely been asking the same questions to every candidate. That means they’ve been getting similar answers, within a range. Sure, some people will have better experience and are able to convey their value better, but the answers will be in the same vein.</p><p>The opportunity to ask questions is your chance to stand out and gain an edge over the competition.</p><p>During my job search, I went on 50+ interviews at dozens of companies. I used those opportunities to split test different interview questions and sets to see which were the most effective. Based on feedback and the result of the interview, I found that these 5 questions were the most effective:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Questions To Ask At The End Of Your Phone Interview</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote>1. What Is Your Favorite Part About Working For Company X?</blockquote><blockquote>2. What Is The Biggest Challenge Your Team Is Facing Right Now?</blockquote><blockquote>3. Let’s Fast Forward One Year - You’re Looking Back On This Hire. What Did They Do To Exceed All Expectations?</blockquote><blockquote>4. What Is The Most Unexpected Lesson You’ve Learned While Working At Company X?</blockquote><blockquote>5. Tell Me A Little Bit More About You, What Do You Like To Do Outside Of Work?</blockquote><p>There are specific, science-backed reasons around why these questions are so effective. To learn more about the principles behind them, along with a few psychology “hacks” you can use to boost your chances of landing a positive impression with your interviewer, <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/5-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview/\" rel=\"noopener\">give this article a read.</a></p><h4 id=\"tip-6-research-salaries-for-this-position-come-up-with-your-number-\">Tip #6: Research Salaries For This Position &amp; Come Up With “Your Number”</h4><p>This one is a doozie!</p><p>Tripping up on a question about “a time you failed” or “your career path” is one thing - there will be a chance to make up for it. Messing up the conversation about your salary expectations can kill your ability to negotiate down the road, which is exactly why interviewers <strong>love</strong> to ask it early on.</p><p>The good news is that, with a little research and preparation, you can ace this question an turn it into a 20% raise at the end of the process. Here’s how - I’ve included the abbreviated version of making that happen below. For the full detailed walkthrough on negotiating your salary, <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/salary-negotiation/\" rel=\"noopener\">check out this article</a>:</p><h4 id=\"step-1-know-your-worth\">Step #1: Know Your Worth</h4><p>The internet makes it pretty easy to gauge what other people are being paid for similar positions. My three favorite sites for this are Glassdoor, Paysa, and Salary.com.</p><p>The best case scenario is finding a salary range for the exact role and company you want, but that’s a rare jackpot. Alternatively, you can look at ranges for that job title in the city where you plan to work - here’s the average for Project Managers in New York (via Glassdoor):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/zDp1Es4B3b7ejKIKLywxWzr-ygjInoUitoVc\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"zDp1Es4B3b7ejKIKLywxWzr-ygjInoUitoVc\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Or see what your target company’s competitors are offering for similar positions. Let’s say you wanted to work as a Creative Strategist at Twitter, but no one had submitted salaries on Glassdoor. You could use Paysa to look up the range for the same job title at Facebook:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/eXmGafCyNtbi0m-0re3H2C0K43CKXXgpxXST\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"eXmGafCyNtbi0m-0re3H2C0K43CKXXgpxXST\" width=\"800\" height=\"210\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>You don’t have to be scientifically accurate here, the goal is to get an idea of what’s reasonable when it comes to compensation for your target position. If pushed, you want to be able to provide a figure in the upper range of the range you found. Here’s how to handle that conversation:</p><h4 id=\"step-2-preach-fit-over-money\">Step #2: Preach Fit Over Money</h4><p>The #1 rule of negotiating salary is that the first person to throw out a number ends up at a big disadvantage.</p><p>When your interviewer says <em>“can you tell me a little bit more about your salary expectations?”</em> or <em>“can you tell me how much you made at your previous role?”</em>, don’t immediately cave and give them the info they want. Instead, tell them that you’re flexible on salary but finding the right fit is your #1 priority.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Handling The Salary Question In A Phone Interview</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Can you give me an idea of your salary expectations for this role?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>You: </strong>I am flexible on salary and compensation, my number one priority is making sure this is the right fit for both of us.</blockquote><p>That <em>should </em>get you out of the limelight for the moment and buy you some time.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Hit Them With 75%-80% Of The Upper Limit</strong></p><p>At some point, you’ll need to cough up a number.</p><p>Your interviewer might say <em>“we don’t move forward unless we have a firm number”, </em>or you may have made it to the final round, or maybe they gave you an offer and it was a lowball!</p><p>In those cases, the best thing to do is, give them a number that sits in the 75 - 80% range of the upper limit. Using our Project Manager role from the screenshot above, PMs make an average of $98k per year but the upper limit is $141k. 75% of $141k is $105K so that is your number!</p><p>Give it to them and see how they react.</p><h4 id=\"tip-7-practice-with-friends-or-family\">Tip #7: Practice With Friends Or Family</h4><p>Finally, one of the best things you can do to prepare is get a second opinion.</p><p>We all tend to be biased about our own abilities (for better or worse), having someone you trust running a mock interview can help you identify any additional weaknesses to shore up before the big day. Try to find someone objective who has some experience in the same industry as your target role.</p><p>Give them some background on the role, ask them to pick a few of the “core” questions (at random), and ask them to throw in a few curve balls to keep you on your toes. Do your best to treat this as if it were a real interview - do it over the phone, avoid any non-relevant small talk, and try to recreate the environment you’re going to encounter during the real phone interview.</p><h4 id=\"preparation-complete-\">Preparation Complete!</h4><p>If you follow all of the tips laid out above, you should be incredibly well prepared to crush your upcoming phone interview. But all that prep doesn’t matter if you don’t capitalize on it during the interview.</p><p>The next two sections will walk you through a few tips to help you set up the right environment, overcome nerves/anxiety, and help you make an impression that solidifies your spot in the next round.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/YPpDa5bqHjWIAGndtuHQUajEJ27sLFowNA2G\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"YPpDa5bqHjWIAGndtuHQUajEJ27sLFowNA2G\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"what-to-do-20-minutes-before-your-phone-interview-5-tips-\">What To Do 20 Minutes Before Your Phone Interview (5 Tips)</h3><p>I’ll admit, these are fairly “obvious” but there’s a reason everyone else talks about them - they work. Make sure you clear your schedule at least 15 - 20 minutes before your interview so you can get settled and get into the right mindset.</p><h4 id=\"tip-8-find-somewhere-quiet\">Tip #8: Find Somewhere Quiet</h4><p>Background noise definitely does not leave a professional impression, and it can kill your ability to focus. You don’t want a door slamming as your interviewer introduces themselves, or your coworker yelling <em>“you’ve gotta be f***ing kidding me!” </em>as you’re explaining your biggest weakness.</p><p>Despite our best efforts, studies have proven that <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/science-clear-multitasking-doesnt-work/\" rel=\"noopener\">humans simply can’t multi-task</a>. Instead, your attention gets divided so you can only give a maximum of 50% if you’re trying to focus on two things at once (and even less as you add more focal points).</p><p>You may think of multi-tasking as a conscious effort to text your friend while talking to your Mom on speakerphone, but it happens at the subconscious level as well. It’s harder to come up with an answer on the fly when your brain is busy trying to block out background noise. Save yourself the trouble and find somewhere nice and quiet for your phone interview.</p><h4 id=\"tip-9-use-headphones-to-take-the-call\">Tip #9: Use Headphones To Take The Call</h4><p>This one is super easy - plug in your headphones and take your call using them. This frees up your hands to scroll through notes you have prepared and simply use them to speak (which actually helps you <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/talking-with-hands-gestures_us_56afcfaae4b0b8d7c230414e\" rel=\"noopener\">express your thoughts more effectively</a> - even over the phone), bringing us to our next tip:</p><h4 id=\"tip-10-have-important-resources-ready-on-your-computer\">Tip #10: Have Important Resources Ready On Your Computer</h4><p>While phone interviews kill our ability to include body language in our message, they give us the advantage of being able to have helpful resources right in front of us. My advice is to close out everything on your computer except for one browser with the following items open in different tabs:</p><ul><li>Your Resume</li><li>The Job Description</li><li>Your Interviewer’s LinkedIn Profile</li><li>The Questions You Want To Ask Your Interviewer</li><li>Google</li></ul><p>These resources will allow you to pull up any information you might need on the fly, which can save you if you have a brain fart or the interviewer catches you off guard with something.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Pro Tip: </em></strong>It sounds weird, but looking at a picture of your interviewer (e.g. their LinkedIn profile picture) can help you sound more natural on the phone. It’s much easier for our brains to pretend we’re in a conversation when we look at a picture vs. a Word doc.</blockquote><h4 id=\"tip-11-check-your-connection\">Tip #11: Check Your Connection</h4><p>Once you’re set up in a quiet space with all of your resources pulled up, give a friend or family member a call. You should keep it short so you have time for the next tip, but you want to make sure that you can carry on a conversation without breaking up or any weird interference. It’s rare, but you’re better off taking two minutes to be safe than sorry.</p><h4 id=\"tip-12-meditate\">Tip #12: Meditate</h4><p>Whoa, like a monk!?</p><p>Exactly like a monk.</p><p>Meditation is an insanely powerful tool when it comes to gaining an edge in your phone interview. Its <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation\" rel=\"noopener\">medically backed benefits</a> - reducing stress, controlling anxiety, increased mental clarity, increased attention span, etc. - all directly correlate with better interview results. You can get all of these benefits in as little as 2 - 5 minutes of meditation.</p><p>It’s not hard either. If you’ve never meditated before, all you need to do is follow this box breathing exercise for a few minutes:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/o2JyB4CPf3OO8nWV2H0z8QMY5Y-2tn5Ub2k9\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"o2JyB4CPf3OO8nWV2H0z8QMY5Y-2tn5Ub2k9\" width=\"729\" height=\"408\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Make sure to give yourself a minute or two before your interview to allow your breathing and your mental state to return to baseline. Now you’re ready to pick up the phone, ace the phone interview, and take one step closer to your dream job!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/mkdp-ClJDR9btk2iSkokLZYvZzqo-hbws58e\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"mkdp-ClJDR9btk2iSkokLZYvZzqo-hbws58e\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"2-post-interview-actions-that-will-help-you-land-the-next-round\">2 Post-Interview Actions That Will Help You Land The Next Round</h3><p>Whew!</p><p>You hang up the phone and exhale all of that nervous energy - mission complete. Now it’s out of your hands, you did everything you could, right?</p><p>Not so fast. The phone interview may be over but your chance to make an impression and set yourself apart from the other applicants isn’t.</p><p>This section is <em>critically important. </em>Why? Because most candidates do a lot of the stuff we talked about above. They may not do it to the level of depth that I suggested, but they at least cover their bases.</p><p>The tips below are proven to have the largest impact on your chances of getting hired (according to the data I’ve collected on hundreds of job seekers):</p><h4 id=\"tip-13-send-a-thank-you-note\">Tip #13: Send A Thank You Note</h4><p>Thanking people is common sense and common courtesy, right?</p><p>Turns out that <strong>only 24% of candidates actually send a thank you note. </strong>On top of that, <a href=\"https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/job-interview-tips/a-little-thanks-goes-a-long-way?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release\" rel=\"noopener\">data shows</a> that close to 80% of hiring managers feel that thank you notes are helpful when deciding between candidates. 22% of employers are<em> </em>less likely to hire a candidate who does <strong>not</strong> send a thank you and <a href=\"http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2012-06-14-Survey-Reveals-Email-Phone-Call-Are-Preferred-Methods-for-Post-Interview-Follow-Up\" rel=\"noopener\">91% actually <em>like</em> being thanked</a> (imagine that!).</p><p>Talk about low hanging fruit!</p><p>We don’t just want to go one notch above the competition though. We want to squeeze everything we can out of this opportunity, which is why you shouldn’t be writing a basic “thank you for your time”. You want to show that you listened, absorbed, and can contribute more.</p><p>I’ve written an entire article on how to do this effectively, you can read and <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/interview-thank-you-email/\" rel=\"noopener\">download my copy/paste thank you template for free</a>.</p><h4 id=\"tip-14-prepare-a-value-validation-project\">Tip #14: Prepare A Value Validation Project</h4><p>Last, but not least, this is the most effective tool I can recommend for any job seeker: the <a href=\"http://cultivatedculture.com/value-validation-project\" rel=\"noopener\">Value Validation Project (VVP)</a>.</p><p>VVPs are essentially deliverables that highlight your value against a specific need that the company has. It could be solutions to a problem, ideas for an upcoming release, valuable feedback from their customers, or simply a chance to flex your skills in a way that gets noticed.</p><p>You can find an angle for your VVP a number of different ways.</p><p>Reading back through your research on the company is a great start, or leveraging the information your interviewer gave you around their biggest challenge is another. When all else fails, you can always go out and poll the company’s customers (if anyone is going to give you brutally honest feedback, it’s them).</p><p>Then you can build out a deliverable that highlights your value against that angle. Here’s a great example of a VVP that helped someone in the Cultivated Culture community land a job at AirBnB:</p><h4 id=\"cam-identifies-customer-pain-points-offers-solutions\"><strong>Cam Identifies Customer Pain Points &amp; Offers Solutions</strong></h4><p>Cam was a student looking to score a job at AirBnB.</p><p>She had applied online and blasted out emails to anyone she could find at AirBnB, but no one was biting. She was left with two choices: give up and move on or find a way to bring value that they couldn’t ignore.</p><p>Cam doubled down and turned to AirBnB’s user base.</p><p>She combed through social media logging all the complaints AirBnB’s users share publicly, then she analyzed the data to identify two major problems:</p><ol><li>The lack of a keyword specific search (finding listings that specifically had “hot tubs” or “fireplaces” for example.</li><li>How freaking hard it was to get in touch with someone from AirBnB’s customer service team</li></ol><p>Cam created a deck that highlighted those issues along with her two data-backed solutions:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/ERhAGCbggmtW5NpKaB341UPPDKL6J7inlNx0\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ERhAGCbggmtW5NpKaB341UPPDKL6J7inlNx0\" width=\"800\" height=\"408\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Then she followed up with everyone she’d emailed before. A few days later, she was sitting in their offices for an interview. Shortly after that, she was hired!</p><p>VVPs like this are incredibly effective because they allow you to:</p><ul><li>Prove out your value in a tangible way (as opposed to relying on a bullet in your resume)</li><li>Show your enthusiasm for the company and solving its problems</li><li>Go above and beyond - no other candidates are doing stuff like this</li></ul><p>When your phone interview is over and your thank you email is sent, you can focus on using the information you’ve gained so far to build out a VVP.</p><p>Once it’s ready, you can send it to the interviewer and say, <em>“Thanks so much again for your time last week. I’ve been thinking a lot about [topic that relates to your VVP] so I went ahead and put together some ideas. They’re attached here! If you have a second to take a look, I’d love to get your feedback.”</em></p><p>If your phone interview went well, this will be the icing on the cake. If there was a doubt in the interviewer’s mind, this should help you overcome it and land a spot in the next round!</p><h4 id=\"want-the-inside-info-on-landing-a-dream-job-without-connections-without-experience-without-applying-online\">Want the inside info on landing a dream job without connections, without “experience,” &amp;

When you don’t hear back, you wonder what went wrong:</p><p><em>“Was it the single page or the lack of a summary? Honestly, who gives a s**t at this point.

If you don’t know what consistently works, you can’t lay out a system to get there.</p><p>It’s easy to say “one page works best” when you’ve seen it happen a few times. But how does it hold up when we look at 100 resumes across different industries, experience levels, and job titles?</p><p>That’s what this article aims to answer.</p><p>Over the past four years, I’ve personally applied to hundreds of companies and coached hundreds of people through the job search process. This has given me a huge opportunity to measure, analyze, and test the effectiveness of different resume strategies at scale.</p><p>This article is going to walk through everything I’ve learned about resumes over the past 4 years, including:</p><ul><li>Mistakes that more than 95% of people make, causing their resumes to get tossed immediately</li><li>Three things that consistently appear in the resumes of highly effective job searchers (who go on to land jobs at the world’s best companies)</li><li>A quick hack that will help you stand out from the competition and instantly build relationships with whomever is reading your resume (increasing your chances of hearing back and getting hired)</li><li>The exact resume template that got me interviews and offers at Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Uber, and more</li></ul><p>When you're done with this post, you can use <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/resume-templates/\">my free resume builder</a> to apply everything you learned into a beautiful, ATS-friendly resume that actually gets results.</p><p>Before we get to the unconventional strategies that will help set you apart, we need to make sure our foundational bases are covered. That starts with understanding the mistakes most job seekers make so we can make our resume bulletproof.</p><h3 id=\"resume-mistakes-that-95-of-people-make\">Resume Mistakes That 95% Of People Make</h3><p>Most resumes that come through an online portal or across a recruiter’s desk are tossed out because they violate a simple rule.</p><p>When recruiters scan a resume, the first thing they look for is mistakes. Your resume could be fantastic, but if you violate a rule like using an unprofessional email address or improper grammar, it’s going to get tossed out.</p><p>Our goal is to fully understand the triggers that cause recruiters/ATS systems to make the snap decisions on who stays and who goes.</p><p>In order to get inside the heads of these decision makers, I collected data from dozens of recruiters and hiring mangers across industries. These people have several hundred years of hiring experience under their belts and they’ve reviewed 100,000+ resumes across industries.</p><p>They broke down the five most common mistakes that cause them to cut resumes from the pile:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5Zbr3HFeKSjvPGZdq_LCKA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*5Zbr3HFeKSjvPGZdq_LCKA\" width=\"800\" height=\"547\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-five-most-common-resume-mistakes-according-to-recruiters-hiring-managers-\">The Five Most Common Resume Mistakes (According To Recruiters &amp; Hiring Managers)</h3><p><strong>Issue #1:</strong> Sloppiness (typos, spelling errors, &amp; grammatical mistakes). Close to 60% of resumes have some sort of typo or grammatical issue.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>Have your resume reviewed by three separate sources — spell checking software, a friend, and a professional. Spell check should be covered if you’re using Microsoft Word or Google Docs to create your resume.</p><p>A friend or family member can cover the second base, but make sure you trust them with reviewing the whole thing. You can always include an obvious mistake to see if they catch it.</p><p>Finally, you can hire a professional editor on <a href=\"http://www.upwork.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork</a>. It shouldn’t take them more than 15–20 minutes to review so it’s worth paying a bit more for someone with high ratings and lots of hours logged.</p><p><strong>Issue #2: </strong>Summaries are too long and formal. Many resumes include summaries that consist of paragraphs explaining why they are a “driven, results oriented team player.” When hiring managers see a block of text at the top of the resume, you can bet they aren’t going to read the whole thing. If they do give it a shot and read something similar to the sentence above, they’re going to give up on the spot.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>Summaries are highly effective, but they should be in bullet form and showcase your most relevant experience for the role. For example, if I’m applying for a new business sales role my first bullet might read “Responsible for driving $11M of new business in 2018, achieved 168% attainment (#1 on my team).”</p><p><strong>Issue #3: </strong>Too many buzz words. Remember our driven team player from the last paragraph? Phrasing like that makes hiring managers cringe because your attempt to stand out actually makes you sound like everyone else.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>Instead of using buzzwords, write naturally, use bullets, and include quantitative results whenever possible. Would you rather hire a salesperson who “is responsible for driving new business across the healthcare vertical to help companies achieve their goals” or “drove $15M of new business last quarter, including the largest deal in company history”? Skip the buzzwords and focus on results.</p><p><strong>Issue #4: </strong>Having a resume that is more than one page. The average employer spends six seconds reviewing your resume — if it’s more than one page, it probably isn’t going to be read. When asked, recruiters from Google and Barclay’s both said multiple page resumes “are the bane of their existence.”</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>Increase your margins, decrease your font, and cut down your experience to highlight the most relevant pieces for the role. It may seem impossible but it’s worth the effort. When you’re dealing with recruiters who see hundreds of resumes every day, you want to make their lives as easy as possible.</p><h3 id=\"more-common-mistakes-facts-backed-by-industry-research-\">More Common Mistakes &amp; Facts (Backed By Industry Research)</h3><p>In addition to personal feedback, I combed through dozens of recruitment survey results to fill any gaps my contacts might have missed. Here are a few more items you may want to consider when writing your resume:</p><ul><li>The average interviewer spends 6 seconds scanning your resume</li><li>The majority of interviewers have not looked at your resume until<br> you walk into the room</li><li>76% of resumes are discarded for an unprofessional email address</li><li>Resumes with a photo have an 88% rejection rate</li><li>58% of resumes have typos</li><li>Applicant tracking software typically eliminates 75% of resumes due to a lack of keywords and phrases being present</li></ul><p>Now that you know every mistake you need to avoid, the first item on your to-do list is to comb through your current resume and make sure it doesn’t violate anything mentioned above.</p><p>Once you have a clean resume, you can start to focus on more advanced tactics that will really make you stand out. There are a few unique elements you can use to push your application over the edge and finally get your dream company to notice you.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*KthhefFO33-8tm0kBEPbig.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*KthhefFO33-8tm0kBEPbig\" width=\"800\" height=\"293\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-3-elements-of-a-resume-that-will-get-you-hired\">The 3 Elements Of A Resume That Will Get You Hired</h3><p>My analysis showed that highly effective resumes typically include three specific elements: quantitative results, a simple design, and a quirky interests section. This section breaks down all three elements and shows you how to maximize their impact.</p><h3 id=\"quantitative-results\">Quantitative Results</h3><p>Most resumes lack them.</p><p>Which is a shame because my data shows that they make the biggest difference between resumes that land interviews and resumes that end up in the trash.</p><p>Here’s an example from a recent resume that was emailed to me:</p><blockquote><strong>Experience</strong></blockquote><blockquote>+ Identified gaps in policies and processes and made recommendations for solutions at the department and institution level</blockquote><blockquote>+ Streamlined processes to increase efficiency and enhance quality</blockquote><blockquote>+ Directly supervised three managers and indirectly managed up to 15 staff on multiple projects</blockquote><blockquote>+ Oversaw execution of in-house advertising strategy</blockquote><blockquote>+ Implemented comprehensive social media plan</blockquote><p>As an employer, that tells me absolutely nothing about what to expect if I hire this person.</p><p>They executed an in-house marketing strategy. Did it work? How did they measure it? What was the ROI?</p><p>They also also identified gaps in processes and recommended solutions. What was the result? Did they save time and operating expenses? Did it streamline a process resulting in more output?</p><p>Finally, they managed a team of three supervisors and 15 staffers. How did that team do? Was it better than the other teams at the company? What results did they get and how did those improve under this person’s management?</p><p>See what I’m getting at here?</p><p>These types of bullets talk about daily activities, but companies don’t care about what you do every day. They care about results. By including measurable metrics and achievements in your resume, you’re showcasing the value that the employer can expect to get if they hire you.</p><p>Let’s take a look at revised versions of those same bullets:</p><blockquote><strong>Experience</strong></blockquote><blockquote>+ Managed a team of 20 that consistently outperformed other departments in lead generation, deal size, and overall satisfaction (based on our culture survey)</blockquote><blockquote>+ Executed in-house marketing strategy that resulted in a 15% increase in monthly leads along with a 5% drop in the cost per lead</blockquote><blockquote>+ Implemented targeted social media campaign across Instagram &amp; Pintrest, which drove an additional 50,000 monthly website visits and generated 750 qualified leads in 3 months</blockquote><p>If you were in the hiring manager’s shoes, which resume would you choose?</p><p>That’s the power of including quantitative results.</p><h3 id=\"simple-aesthetic-design-that-hooks-the-reader\">Simple, Aesthetic Design That Hooks The Reader</h3><p>These days, it’s easy to get carried away with our mission to “stand out.” I’ve seen resume overhauls from graphic designers, video resumes, and even resumes <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/this-guy-hides-his-resume-in-boxes-of-donuts-to-score-job-interviews\" rel=\"noopener\">hidden in a box of donuts.</a></p><p>While those can work in very specific situations, we want to aim for a strategy that consistently gets results. The format I saw the most success with was a black and white Word template with sections in this order:</p><ul><li>Summary</li><li>Interests</li><li>Experience</li><li>Education</li><li>Volunteer Work (if you have it)</li></ul><p>This template is effective because it’s familiar and easy for the reader to digest.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, hiring managers scan resumes for an average of 6 seconds. If your resume is in an unfamiliar format, those 6 seconds won’t be very comfortable for the hiring manager. Our brains prefer things we can easily recognize. You want to make sure that a hiring manager can actually catch a glimpse of who you are during their quick scan of your resume.</p><p>If we’re not relying on design, this hook needs to come from the <em>Summary</em> section at the top of your resume.</p><p>This section should be done in bullets (not paragraph form) and it should contain 3–4 highlights of the most relevant experience you have for the role. For example, if I was applying for a New Business Sales position, my summary could look like this:</p><blockquote><strong>Summary</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Drove quarterly average of $11M in new business with a quota attainment of 128% (#1 on my team)</blockquote><blockquote>Received award for largest sales deal of the year</blockquote><blockquote>Developed and trained sales team on new lead generation process that increased total leads by 17% in 3 months, resulting in 4 new deals worth $7M</blockquote><p>Those bullets speak directly to the value I can add to the company if I was hired for the role.</p><h3 id=\"an-interests-section-that-s-quirky-unique-relatable\">An “Interests” Section That’s Quirky, Unique, &amp; Relatable</h3><p>This is a little “hack” you can use to instantly build personal connections and positive associations with whomever is reading your resume.</p><p>Most resumes have a skills/interests section, but it’s usually parked at the bottom and offers little to no value. It’s time to change things up.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/inside-the-consumer-mind/201302/how-emotions-influence-what-we-buy\" rel=\"noopener\">Research shows</a> that people rely on emotions, not information, to make decisions. Big brands use this principle all the time — emotional responses to advertisements are more influential on a person’s intent to buy than the content of an ad.</p><p>You probably remember Apple’s famous “Get A Mac” campaign:</p><p>When it came to specs and performance, Macs didn’t blow every single PC out of the water. But these ads solidified who was “cool” and who wasn’t, which was worth a few extra bucks to a few million people.</p><p>By tugging at our need to feel “cool,” Apple’s campaign led to a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070608005253/en/Apple-Mac-Named-Successful-Marketing-Campaign-2007\" rel=\"noopener\">42% increase in market share</a> and a record sales year for Macbooks.</p><p>Now we’re going to take that same tactic and apply it to your resume.</p><p>If you can invoke an emotional response from your recruiter, you can influence the mental association they assign to you. This gives you a major competitive advantage.</p><p>Let’s start with a question — what could you talk about for hours?</p><p>It could be cryptocurrency, cooking, World War 2, World of Warcraft, or how Google’s bet on segmenting their company under the Alphabet is going to impact the technology sector over the next 5 years.</p><p>Did a topic (or two) pop into year head? Great.</p><p>Now think about what it would be like to have a conversation with someone who was just as passionate and knew just as much as you did on the topic. It’d be pretty awesome, right? <em>Finally, </em>someone who gets it!</p><p>That’s exactly the kind of emotional response we’re aiming to get from a hiring manager.</p><p>There are five “neutral” topics out there that people enjoy talking about:</p><ol><li>Food/Drink</li><li>Sports</li><li>College</li><li>Hobbies</li><li>Geography (travel, where people are from, etc.)</li></ol><p>These topics are present in plenty of interest sections but we want to take them one step further.</p><p>Let’s say you had the best night of your life at the Full Moon Party in Thailand. Which of the following two options would you be more excited to read:</p><ul><li>Traveling</li><li>Ko Pha Ngan beaches (where the full moon party is held)</li></ul><p>Or, let’s say that you went to Duke (an ACC school) and still follow their basketball team. Which would you be more pumped about:</p><ul><li>College Sports</li><li>ACC Basketball (Go Blue Devils!)</li></ul><p>In both cases, the second answer would probably invoke a larger emotional response because it is tied directly to your experience.</p><p>I want you to think about your interests that fit into the five categories I mentioned above.</p><p>Now I want you to write a specific favorite associated with each category in parentheses next to your original list. For example, if you wrote travel you can add (ask me about the time I was chased by an elephant in India) or (specifically meditation in a Tibetan monastery).</p><p>Here is the <a href=\"http://cultivatedculture.com/resume-skills-section/\" rel=\"noopener\">exact set of interests</a> I used on my resume when I interviewed at Google, Microsoft, and Twitter:</p><p><em>ABC Kitchen’s Atmosphere, Stumptown Coffee (primarily cold brew), Michael Lewis (Liar’s Poker), Fishing (especially fly), Foods That Are Vehicles For Hot Sauce, ACC Sports (Go Deacs!) &amp; The New York Giants</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*ONxtGr_xUYmz4_Xe66aeng.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*ONxtGr_xUYmz4_Xe66aeng\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you want to cheat here, my experience shows that anything about hot sauce is an instant conversation starter.</p><h3 id=\"the-proven-plug-play-resume-template\">The Proven Plug &amp; Play Resume Template</h3><p>Now that we have our strategies down, it’s time to apply these tactics to a real resume. Our goal is to write something that increases your chances of hearing back from companies, enhances your relationships with hiring managers, and ultimately helps you score the job offer.</p><p>The example below is the exact resume that I used to land interviews and offers at Microsoft, Google, and Twitter. I was targeting roles in Account Management and Sales, so this sample is tailored towards those positions. We’ll break down each section below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*B2RQ89ue2dGymRdwMY2lBA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*B2RQ89ue2dGymRdwMY2lBA\" width=\"800\" height=\"1011\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>First, I want you to notice how clean this is. Each section is clearly labeled and separated and flows nicely from top to bottom.</p><p>My summary speaks directly to the value I’ve created in the past around company culture and its bottom line:</p><ul><li>I consistently exceeded expectations</li><li>I started my own business in the space (and saw real results)</li><li>I’m a team player who prioritizes culture</li></ul><p>I purposefully include my Interests section right below my Summary. If my hiring manager’s six second scan focused on the summary, I know they’ll be interested. Those bullets cover all the subconscious criteria for qualification in sales. They’re going to be curious to read more in my Experience section.</p><p>By sandwiching my Interests in the middle, I’m upping their visibility and increasing the chance of creating that personal connection.</p><p>You never know — the person reading my resume may also be a hot sauce connoisseur and I don’t want that to be overlooked because my interests were sitting at the bottom.</p><p>Next, my Experience section aims to flesh out the points made in my Summary. I mentioned exceeding my quota up top, so I included two specific initiatives that led to that attainment, including measurable results:</p><ul><li>A partnership leveraging display advertising to drive users to a gamified experience. The campaign resulted in over 3000 acquisitions and laid the groundwork for the 2nd largest deal in company history.</li><li>A partnership with a top tier agency aimed at increasing conversions for a client by improving user experience and upgrading tracking during a company-wide website overhaul (the client has ~20 brand sites). Our efforts over 6 months resulted in a contract extension worth 316% more than their original deal.</li></ul><p>Finally, I included my education at the very bottom starting with the most relevant coursework.</p><p><strong>Download My Resume Templates For Free</strong></p><p>You can download a copy of the resume sample above as well as a plug and play template here:</p><p><strong>Austin’s Resume: </strong><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/182gN6Kt1kBCo1LgMjtsGHOQW2lzATpZr/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener\">Click To Download</a></p><p><strong>Plug &amp; Play Resume Template: </strong><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3WIcEDrxeYYdXFPVlcyQlJIbWc\" rel=\"noopener\">Click To Download</a></p><h3 id=\"bonus-tip-an-unconventional-resume-hack-to-help-you-beat-applicant-tracking-software\">Bonus Tip: An Unconventional Resume “Hack” To Help You Beat Applicant Tracking Software</h3><p>If you’re not already familiar, Applicant Tracking Systems are pieces of software that companies use to help “automate” the hiring process.</p><p>After you hit submit on your online application, the ATS software scans your resume looking for specific keywords and phrases (if you want more details, <a href=\"https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/\" rel=\"noopener\">this article</a> does a good job of explaining ATS).</p><p>If the language in your resume matches up, the software sees it as a good fit for the role and will pass it on to the recruiter. However, even if you’re highly qualified for the role but you don’t use the right wording, your resume can end up sitting in a black hole.</p><p>I’m going to teach you a little hack to help improve your chances of beating the system and getting your resume in the hands of a human:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Highlight and select the entire job description page and copy it to your clipboard.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Head over to <a href=\"https://www.wordclouds.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">WordClouds.com</a> and click on the “Word List” button at the top. Towards the top of the pop up box, you should see a link for Paste/Type Text. Go ahead and click that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now paste the entire job description into the box, then hit “Apply.”</p><p>WordClouds is going to spit out an image that showcases every word in the job description. The larger words are the ones that appear most frequently (and the ones you want to make sure to include when writing your resume). Here’s an example for a data a science role:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*O7VO1C9nhC9LZct7vexTbA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*O7VO1C9nhC9LZct7vexTbA\" width=\"800\" height=\"464\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>You can also get a quantitative view by clicking “Word List” again after creating your cloud. That will show you the number of times each word appeared in the job description:</p><p>9 data</p><p>6 models</p><p>4 experience</p><p>4 learning</p><p>3 Experience</p><p>3 develop</p><p>3 team</p><p>2 Qualifications</p><p>2 statistics</p><p>2 techniques</p><p>2 libraries</p><p>2 preferred</p><p>2 research</p><p>2 business</p><p>When writing your resume, your goal is to include those words in the same proportions as the job description.</p><p>It’s not a guaranteed way to beat the online application process, but it will definitely help improve your chances of getting your foot in the door!</p><h3 id=\"want-the-inside-info-on-landing-a-dream-job-without-connections-without-experience-without-applying-online\">Want The Inside Info On Landing A Dream Job Without Connections, Without “Experience,” &amp;

href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-you-can-land-a-6-figure-job-in-tech-with-no-connections-6eed0de26ea4/#.n25pxtah1\">how you can land a 6-figure job in tech with no connections</a> by generating referrals from people inside those companies.</p><p>The article found its way in front of a lot of people, and they had a lot of questions. The most common questions focused on one thing: experience.</p><p>Many people find that their current career isn’t living up to their expectations. They want to change paths, but they don’t have any experience in another field, and no idea where to start.</p><p>In this post I’ll show you how to quickly gain experience in any field, as well as how you can leverage that new experience to land job offers in that field.</p><p>I personally used this strategy to transition from the medical field — where I was working in hospital operating rooms — to the tech industry, where I received offers from Google and other tech companies (along with a 200% raise).</p><h3 id=\"myths-about-things-you-don-t-need-when-switching-fields\">Myths about things you DON’T need when switching fields</h3><p>Before we dive in, I think it’s important to address a few “myths” about changing industries:</p><ul><li>You <strong>don’t </strong>need an extensive network of contacts. In fact, you don’t need any contacts at all — you can make them all on your own.</li><li>You <strong>don’t</strong> need a degree in the field you want to switch to. Perception is reality, and results speak volumes when it comes to perception. They are worth more than any degree or previous job title. More on that later.</li><li>You <strong>don’t</strong> need money. Everything you need to know can be learned for free. In fact, I’m going to show you how this process can actually help you generate a second stream of income.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/AC8vUZqu7lj0SZtgdaSw66RzTkokFlJqALfm\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"AC8vUZqu7lj0SZtgdaSw66RzTkokFlJqALfm\" width=\"720\" height=\"305\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://StareCat.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">StareCat.com</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Next, I’m going to outline the exact steps I used to land a job in a totally different industry so you can make it happen for yourself.</p><h3 id=\"part-1-painting-a-picture-of-the-perfect-candidate\">Part 1: Painting a picture of the perfect candidate</h3><p>The good news about entering a completely different field is that you are a blank canvas. You can choose your skills and mold yourself into the perfect candidate.</p><h4 id=\"what-does-perfection-look-like\">What does perfection look like?</h4><p>In order to become the ideal candidate, we must first understand what “ideal” looks like in the eyes of the people who will be hiring you. There are two ways to accomplish this:</p><h4 id=\"job-descriptions\">Job descriptions</h4><p>Job descriptions are essentially resumes in reverse. They spell out the exact skills you need in order to be successful in that particular role. That sounds obvious, but we are going to be looking at this from an atypical lens.</p><p>Let’s take a look at this <em>Growth Marketing Analyst</em> role that I grabbed from Facebook’s site:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Responsibilities</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Leverage data to understand our products in depth, identify areas of opportunity, and execute projects to drive growth and engagement of Facebook users.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Drive projects focusing on new user growth, mobile usage, and revenue — working closely with design, product, engineering, and data teams.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Work both on core Facebook products like news feed, notifications, and mobile, and offsite marketing channels like SEO, SEM, and email.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Use tools like Hadoop/Hive, Oracle, ETL, R, PHP, Python, Excel, MicroStrategy, and many other internal tools to work efficiently at scale.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Minimum Qualifications</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>- BS or MS in Engineering, Computer Science, Math, Physics, Statistics.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- 1+ years experience with SQL.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- 2+ years of quantitative or statistical analysis experience.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- 1+ years of experience managing a project.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- 1+ years of experience in marketing, advertising or growth.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Ability to process and analyze data sets, and interpret them to make business decisions.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Communication skills and ability to manage a project or product.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Preferred Qualifications</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Software development experience.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>- Internet Marketing experience.</em></blockquote><p>What do you see here? What does the ideal candidate look like? What do they need to get hired?</p><p>My guess is that you’re thinking, “Ok, they need a degree in computers or math. Then they need at least two years of experience coding and managing projects at a company.”</p><p>Well, here’s what I see:</p><p>Facebook is looking for someone who understands how to identify trends/patterns within big data that will have a direct impact on revenue. That person also has enough knowledge of programming to efficiently make those discoveries and present them in a simple, concise fashion.</p><p>The main issue a lot of people have is that they think the only way to get “experience” is to work at company or have fancy degrees. This is one of the biggest myths when it comes to job searching.</p><p>In order to understand it, let’s take a step back and think about why companies hire.</p><p>They want someone who will come in and have a large, positive impact on their bottom line.</p><p>Someone could have a PhD in Computer Science and be fluent in all of the programming languages mentioned above, but if they lack the ability to clearly convey results, the company isn’t going to benefit.</p><p>On the other hand, someone who may not have a degree or total fluency but understands how to find impactful insights and presents them in a concise, actionable manner is <em>extremely </em>valuable.</p><p>Your goal is to become that second person.</p><h4 id=\"informational-interviews\">Informational interviews</h4><p>In addition to combing through job descriptions, it’s equally important to get in touch with people who work in the industry.</p><p>They will be able to help you prioritize the skills you found in those job applications, as well as give you some inside info on the intangibles (nuances of the hiring process, putting you in touch with their contacts, etc.).</p><p>I’ve found that the best way to make this happen is by leveraging LinkedIn’s advanced search filters.</p><p>You can search for people at specific companies, with specific titles. If you have LinkedIn Premium, you can even search for people who used to work in your industry and now work in your target industry — or even at your target company.</p><p>Then you can use this email script to reach out:</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Quick Question</p><p><em>Hi [Name],</em></p><p><em>My name is Austin and I currently work at Cultivated Culture. I was browsing through LinkedIn and came across your information — I hope you don’t mind me reaching out of the blue here.</em></p><p><em>I saw that you have extensive experience in Facebook’s Growth Analytics vertical and I’m very interested in learning more about that space. I would love to have the opportunity to run some questions by you, as well as tap into any advice you may have given your knowledge of the industry.</em></p><p><em>I know that your time is extremely valuable so please don’t feel to need to respond in depth. If you do have 5 minutes to chat, I would really appreciate it.</em></p><p><em>Best,</em></p><p><em>Austin</em></p><p>When they agree to a meeting, you’ll want to prepare some questions. They should focus on:</p><ul><li>Identifying which skills are the most crucial for performing daily activities (this will allow you to prioritize)</li><li>Providing some background on how that person got to where they are (you’d be surprised at how many people came from other industries)</li><li>What they would do if they were in your shoes — trying to get this job with little to no experience in the field</li></ul><p>Here are those bullets in question form to help get you started:</p><ol><li>I’ve been doing some research and it seems like <em>[Skill 1] — [Skill 3]</em> are common in the space. Which of these do you think is the most crucial to success?</li><li>I was looking through your LinkedIn and saw that you came from <em>[Previous Role/Company]</em>. How did you initially get involved in this industry and how did you end up at <em>[Current Role]</em>?</li><li>Let’s say you were in my shoes — you’re new to the industry and don’t have too much experience. How would you go about getting your current job? What specific steps would you take?</li></ol><h4 id=\"bringing-it-all-together\">Bringing It All Together</h4><p>Now you have an understanding of the skills that you need, where they stand in terms of priority, and a roadmap from someone who has/had the role you want.</p><p>Next, you need to build a foundation with those skills and use them to generate results that directly align with the company’s goals for that role.</p><h3 id=\"part-2-nailing-the-basics-on-the-cheap-\">Part 2: Nailing The Basics (On The Cheap)</h3><p>Over the next month or two we’re going to focus on building a rock solid understanding of the basics needed for the skills you identified above.</p><p>For now, the best ways to do this are by reading books, taking courses, and creating a sandbox you can use to test your knew knowledge.</p><h4 id=\"reading-up-for-free-\">Reading Up (For Free)</h4><p>Books are a fantastic way to understand the basic concepts of a specific subject. They also happen to be very easy to get for free.</p><p>Remember that public library your parents wanted you to check out when you were a kid? It’s actually still there! Amazing, right?</p><p>The good news for you is that even public libraries have caught up with the times and now carry ebooks. You can borrow them for free like any other book, but they will be sent directly to your phone so you can read them anywhere, anytime. All you need to do is install the Kindle app (which you can get for free for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613?mt=8\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a>).</p><p>In order figure out which books to read, I would Google “best books on [subject]” or <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">go ask some folks on Quora</a>.</p><h4 id=\"taking-courses-for-free-ish-\">Taking Courses (For Free-ish)</h4><p>While books are giving you the 30,000 foot view of your topics, courses will help you figure out the nitty gritty. They are a better way to learn the actual skills because they tend to be interactive and are updated regularly.</p><p>One of the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">best resources for our purposes is Coursera</a>. Coursera aggregates courses from the best professors at the best schools in the country (I’m talking Princeton, Stanford, Harvard — they don’t mess around).</p><p>These courses are fantastic because they are structured like an actual course you would take in college. They have videos, but they also have tests, projects, and forums where students can collaborate. This is key because it helps make the course “sticky” due to the fact that you are committing to all the above rather than just watching a few videos.</p><p>Best of all, at the end of the course, you can receive a certificate stating that you passed the course. It will even have the seal from that university on it! It does cost ~$49 but it’s well worth it because you can put that right on your resume:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/M6qSzo5Kai60qxFkrrG7dmOkAZ7mrXm5z94M\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"M6qSzo5Kai60qxFkrrG7dmOkAZ7mrXm5z94M\" width=\"791\" height=\"612\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Oh this? Just some cred from a top 10 biz school (Courtesy of Coursera)</em></figcaption></figure><h4 id=\"subscribing-to-industry-blogs-newsletters\">Subscribing To Industry Blogs &amp; Newsletters</h4><p>Next, you’re going to want to sign up for some newsletters.</p><p>Blogs stay in business by having the highest quality, most up-to-date information and getting it out there as quickly as possible. This is the easiest way for you to stay on top of current events in the industry while picking up tons of knowledge along the way.</p><p>You can find them using the same method you used to find the books — Googling and hitting up Quora.</p><p>Additionally, try to find a niche blog as they tend to have highly detailed information on your topic. Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>SEO: </strong><a href=\"https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo\" rel=\"noopener\">The 10 Chapter Beginner’s Guide To SEO</a></p><p><strong>Content Marketing: </strong><a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/the-advanced-guide-to-content-marketing/\" rel=\"noopener\">The Advanced Guide To Content Marketing</a></p><p><strong>Facebook Ads:</strong> <a href=\"http://rich20something.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-money-with-facebook-ads/\" rel=\"noopener\">The Ultimate Guide To Making Money With Facebook Ads</a></p><h4 id=\"free-resources-where-applicable-\">Free Resources (Where Applicable)</h4><p>Many industries and fields have a ton of free resources out there to help your learn. For example, if you’re an analytics person — Google Analytics is completely free to set up. Additionally, Google offers an entire course on the platform for free.</p><p>If your plan is to break into the development field, you’re already in the right place. <a href=\"http://www.freecodecamp.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Code Camp</a> is one of many great resources that will help you learn the basics of programming for free.</p><p>Be sure to do a thorough search on your industry. Chances are good that free training resources exist.</p><h4 id=\"bonus-pro-tip-google-alerts\">Bonus Pro Tip: Google Alerts</h4><p>Google Alerts are an awesome way to save yourself hours that you would have spent searching for articles on specific topics or companies.</p><p>You can set them up for anything that you could feasibly search for in Google, but probably want to stick with the salient points like a specific industry, certain skills, the company you want to work for and Beyonce.</p><p>Then, every day, Google will crawl the web and find the most relevant (and worthy) articles on your specific subjects and deliver them straight to your inbox.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts\" rel=\"noopener\">You can sign up for Google alerts here.</a></p><h3 id=\"part-3-getting-paid-to-hone-your-skills\">Part 3: Getting Paid To Hone Your Skills</h3><p>Yup, you read that right. We’re going learn how to have someone pay you to learn the skills you need to change industries.</p><h4 id=\"building-credibility-real-world-results\">Building Credibility &amp; Real-World Results</h4><p>Now that you understand the basics of these skills, it’s time to <em>really </em>develop them.</p><p>I’ve found that the best way to truly learn something is by doing it. I can’t think of a better way of “doing” than selling your skills for some cold hard cash.</p><h3 id=\"rapidly-develop-your-skills-by-freelancing\">Rapidly Develop Your Skills By Freelancing</h3><p>While it may seem like a daunting task, it’s fairly easy to get started in the freelance world even if you have no prior “experience.”</p><p>As Tim Ferriss says, the definition of an expert is someone who knows more than the person they are dealing with.</p><p>There are two ways of going about finding clients when you’re starting out — freelance aggregator sites and traditional cold outreach:</p><h4 id=\"upwork-a-freelance-aggregator-\"><strong>Upwork (A Freelance Aggregator)</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork</a> is a community where business owners come to find freelancers for everything under the sun.</p><p>The beauty of Upwork is that it removes the need for you to invest a lot of time in marketing yourself. It is an inbound site meaning your services will show up to people who are already looking for that particular service, making them more likely to hire. That may also be attractive to someone who is uncomfortable with a traditional sales process.</p><p>The trade off is that, while you save time, Upwork charges a hefty fee for saving you that time. For our purposes, that’s not too terrible because you’re mostly in it for the learning while the money is icing on the cake.</p><p>I recommend using Upwork if you’re having trouble managing the sales process on your own, or if you’re just starting out and need to build up a few success stories.</p><p>If you really want to expand your initial reach, check out <a href=\"http://blog.hubstaff.com/upwork-competitors/\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubstaff’s comprehensive rundown of Upwork alternatives</a> and get yourself on multiple platforms.</p><h4 id=\"cold-outreach\"><strong>Cold Outreach</strong></h4><p>The second option, and the path that I recommend, is handling the sales process on your own. That way you get to keep 100% of the revenue and remove the middle man.</p><p>This can be a bit tougher initially because those businesses may not be actively looking for your services and if you don’t have much sales experience, the learning curve can be steep.</p><p>In this section we’ll through the steps that I used to land my initial clients, build success stories and then use those results to expand my portfolio (and increase my revenue).</p><h3 id=\"define-your-niche\">Define Your Niche</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/mC4uTqrTUHt-SOKnrXQxRMtfmtvDpbN5wk0G\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"mC4uTqrTUHt-SOKnrXQxRMtfmtvDpbN5wk0G\" width=\"800\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Courtesy of Partner’s Title Co.</figcaption></figure><p>Our first step on our freelancing journey is defining our target prospect. Most articles out there tell you that when you start a business your niche should be laser-focused, like Male Golfers, Ages 47–54 who suffer from back pain.</p><p>While I agree that it should be targeted, it’s not reasonable to expect that you’re going to know your target audience in that level of detail before you’ve even worked with a single client.</p><p>You’ll begin to hone in on your ideal niche as you go, but for now we’re going to use the following process to determine our target audience (actually, we’re going to choose 3).</p><h4 id=\"defining-your-initial-target-prospect\">Defining Your Initial Target Prospect</h4><p>Start by making a list of 50 people that you know. It can include everyone from your best friend’s parents to a connection on LinkedIn you met at a conference last year. The only criteria they need to meet is that <em>you must feel comfortable reaching out to that person.</em></p><p>Add these people into <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fasMrAIovSMxIRbpKJzJerPdAcaBXbChCcFebG5XHGU/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener\">this spreadsheet I created for you</a> along with their company type and industry (ignore the email column for now, we’ll get to that later):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/woT0BG5-dDkz6qm0dVEVCK5JUUs-XbT751iH\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"woT0BG5-dDkz6qm0dVEVCK5JUUs-XbT751iH\" width=\"800\" height=\"380\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Now that we have our people, let’s take a look at their company type and industry. Which industries and company types match up best with your knowledge and skill set?</p><p>If we take my list, I know that my marketing skills could benefit a tech company, but they could also benefit a health &amp; wellness startup looking to build an audience. Additionally, know that it’s much easier to sell into startups than corporations when you’re first starting out. With that in mind, my ideal mix is:</p><p><strong>Company Type:</strong> Startup</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Advertising, Tech, Web Development &amp; Health/Wellness</p><p>Now we have one “niche,” but my list here is only 10 people. I want you to try and find 3 different niches where one or more of your skills apply. Then I want you to assign each niche a number and label your spreadsheet (you can also highlight too if that helps):</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/D4weerLCPrZlvJlyq0eGtBRWD9dvTe5uDxfj\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"D4weerLCPrZlvJlyq0eGtBRWD9dvTe5uDxfj\" width=\"800\" height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Awesome! You just defined 3 areas that you can sell into and you have your first set of prospects.</p><p><strong><em>Key Takeaway:</em></strong><em> Don’t get caught up in finding a super-specific niche before you’ve ever booked a client. Keep things broad, take on a few initial clients and your niche will narrow over time.</em></p><h3 id=\"create-time-be-consistent\">Create Time &amp; Be Consistent</h3><p>I have spent a lot of time reading about success. I’ve also spent a lot of time building businesses in hopes of chasing it. After sifting through the thousands of pages and lessons, I found that one thing had the greatest influence on whether I was successful or not:</p><p><strong><em>Consistency</em></strong></p><p>The ability to work on something every single day — regardless of how you feel, how crazy your job is or how many friends tell you to go to happy hour — is the difference between succeeding and failing when you start a business.</p><p>In order to be consistent, you have to create time. Time that you know is not going to be interrupted. For me, that means waking up at 5:30am. For you, early may work, or maybe late at night is your thing. Whatever you do, make sure that it’s a natural fit for you. You don’t want to feel like you have to drag yourself to do this, otherwise it will never work.</p><h4 id=\"put-it-in-your-calendar\">Put It In Your Calendar</h4><p>Start by opening up your Google calendar and finding a 1.5 hour block of time that works for you at least 5 days every week (yes, that includes weekends).</p><p>Create an event and set reminders for 1 hour before and 15 minutes before. Mark that time as “busy” on your calendar:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/JbiK79w6EFtABPTzSSnaJ1kP1sFnUGiqnLdC\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"JbiK79w6EFtABPTzSSnaJ1kP1sFnUGiqnLdC\" width=\"800\" height=\"138\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"hold-yourself-accountable\">Hold Yourself Accountable</h3><p>Now it’s real — ink on paper. However, your calendar invite isn’t going to get you out of bed the day after you went out a little too hard or help you say no to those free concert tickets to see Kanye. If we truly want to stick with this, we’re going to need a little outside help.</p><p>I personally recommend <a href=\"http://www.stickk.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">StickK</a> because I’m a competitive person who doesn’t like losing. StickK basically lets you bet yourself that you will start your business.</p><p>You put down a dollar amount (I recommend $100) and you set a goal. Then you’ll be assigned a “referee” who will hold you accountable. If you complete your goal, you get your $100 back. If you don’t, that money is donated to the charity of your choice.</p><p>I can personally tell you that the thought of $100 being yanked out of my wallet has helped me push through many hangovers.</p><h3 id=\"getting-your-first-client\"><strong>Getting Your First Client</strong></h3><p>Now that we’ve got our service and our niches nailed down, it’s time to get some paying customers.</p><p>Since we don’t have much in the way of a portfolio, we’re going to want to start by aiming for a prospect where we have a personal connection. Then we’re going to leverage the current experience that you have to land the deal.</p><p>Let’s head <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fasMrAIovSMxIRbpKJzJerPdAcaBXbChCcFebG5XHGU/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener\">back to our spreadsheet</a> and look through the list of names that we highlighted in each niche. I want you to go ahead and rank each of these people in the order of how likely they are to help you. Then we’re going to reach out to each from top to bottom.</p><h4 id=\"finding-emails\">Finding Emails</h4><p>If you don’t already have their email, you can easily find it by using <a href=\"http://voilanorbert.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">VoilaNorbert</a> or <a href=\"http://findanyemail.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">FindAnyEmail.net</a>. Once you have it, go ahead and plug it into your spreadsheet for future reference.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/UJY-Mr372YfsZYoj7BKwMnHySYL3mcx6Fwz5\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"UJY-Mr372YfsZYoj7BKwMnHySYL3mcx6Fwz5\" width=\"800\" height=\"138\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h4 id=\"reaching-out\">Reaching Out</h4><p>Now we’re going to reach out to our contact and ask them if they can help us set up a meeting. Here is the exact email template you can use for that:</p><p><strong>Subject: </strong>Quick Question</p><p><em>Hi [<strong>Name]</strong>,</em></p><p><em>Hope you’re doing well! I wanted to let you know about a business I’m starting up called <strong>[Company Name]</strong>. It’s aimed at helping companies <strong>[Insert Value Prop]</strong>.</em></p><p><em>Most recently we were able to <strong>[Insert Success Story]</strong>. I did a quick audit of <strong>[Prospect’s Company]</strong> and I have some ideas that I’d love to share with you. Could you help me get in touch with the correct person? Either way, would love to catch up soon!</em></p><p><em>Best,</em></p><p><strong><em>[Your Name]</em></strong></p><p>All you need to do is fill in their name, your skills and press send.</p><p>I would also highly recommend getting an email tracker such as <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/email-tracking\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubspot </a>(free) or <a href=\"http://www.yesware.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Yesware </a>(better, but costs $). These will allow you to see if your prospect read your message and help you determine whether or not to follow up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/8mtNoVyWmudzlLQeWTXygmbMEV-5KyIupSQw\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"8mtNoVyWmudzlLQeWTXygmbMEV-5KyIupSQw\" width=\"800\" height=\"467\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If they open your email once, that trail is dead. However, if they open it multiple times across multiple days, feel free to follow up with them after 4–5 business days. I have personally followed up with people 8–10 times before eventually getting a response that led to a deal.</p><h4 id=\"preparing-for-the-meeting\">Preparing For The Meeting</h4><p>Once the meeting is set, we want to make a compelling case for why this company needs your services. The best way to do that is using what I like to call <em>The Audit Technique</em>.</p><p>It’s extremely simple and effective:</p><ul><li>Carefully review our prospect’s current set up (website, social media, content, copy, health — whatever fits your service)</li><li>Identify as many issues/improvements as we possibly can</li><li>Determine the measurable impact of fixing these issues</li><li>Share specific strategies for solving 2–3 of the issues and then showcase the potential result of fixing all of them</li><li>Tell them that, regardless of whether or not they hire you, they can keep the audit report</li></ul><p>Boom! Easy.</p><h4 id=\"closing-the-deal\">Closing The Deal</h4><p>In the beginning, most of your prospects aren’t going to be seeking you out. That means that you have to convince them that your services will be worth their time and money. The best way to do that is via the following framework:</p><p><strong><em>1. Address</em></strong></p><p>We’re going to start off the meeting by addressing the issues that you found with their site. Don’t be too critical. The goal here is to make them feel good about their business while also letting them know that there is a lot of untapped potential out there.</p><p>Hand them your Audit Report and walk them through each of the issues. Explain what is happening, why it’s hurting their business, and what the solution is.</p><p><strong><em>2. Illustrate Potential</em></strong></p><p>Once you’ve explained the issues, you want to clarify what the prospect is missing out on. The more quantifiable this is, the better. For example:</p><ul><li>Your call to action on the site isn’t strong enough. Your conversion rate is probably 5% lower than where it should be. If your site gets 30,000 visitors a month, that’s 1,500 people we’re not capturing!</li><li>Instagram accounts like yours typically see 100–300 followers every day, but you are only netting 20–30. If you implement the strategy I laid out here you should see an immediate boost within a few days. That could mean an additional 2,400 followers each month!</li></ul><p>Show them how this is impacting their bottom line. Walk them through the math:</p><blockquote><strong>You:</strong> What is your typical sales conversion rate from your email list?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Prospect:</strong> Hmmm, it’s around 3%</blockquote><blockquote><strong>You:</strong> Wow, that’s pretty good! And how much profit do you make from each sale?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Prospect:</strong> Typically we net around $150 per sale.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>You:</strong> Awesome. Based on my audit, I’m seeing that we’re missing out capturing an additional 3–5% of your site’s traffic due to poor copy and CTA placement. I poked around and saw that your site gets ~30,000 visitors per month which means that we could be capturing an additional 1,500 people every month. Based on the numbers you just gave me, that’s $6,750 per month!</blockquote><p>If you charge $2,000 per month, that’s a no brainer for your prospect. Any business owner would pay $2,000 if they knew it would result in an incremental profit of $4,750 — and you just made $24k this year!</p><h4 id=\"ask-them-for-the-sale\">Ask Them For The Sale</h4><p>Now that you’ve proven out the value — ask them for the sale:</p><ul><li>Tell them that the Audit Report is theirs to keep regardless</li><li>Reiterate the potential opportunity they have to gain</li><li>Outline what next steps look like for hiring you</li><li>Ask them if they want to move forward</li></ul><p>Chances are good that they’ll want some time to think about it. No worries at all — drop note on your calendar to follow up with them 72 hours later.</p><p>You just booked your first client!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/cvAaz8rone46MbW0B-HllFddy9PIi2-tWmbC\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"cvAaz8rone46MbW0B-HllFddy9PIi2-tWmbC\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Now I want you to rinse and repeat this process for everyone on your spreadsheet. If you can get your foot in the door, you can expect about a 5%-10% close rate.</p><h4 id=\"consolation-offering-your-services-for-free\"><strong>Consolation: Offering Your Services For Free</strong></h4><p>Since we’re mostly in this for the learning, this is great option to consider if the above process isn’t initially working out.</p><p>I found that it was much easier to land clients when I had success stories I could speak to. It’s important to figure out a way to get some results before you go all-in on pitching for money.</p><p>You can reach out to businesses, same as above, and offer your services for free. This takes away all of the risk for the company, making them much more likely to agree, while allowing you to get right to the learning and create real-world results.</p><p>Remember, we’re in this to try and find a job we love that pays us what we deserve. That is worth a LOT more than a few paid freelance contracts. If the freelancing turns into a source of revenue, that is icing on the cake.</p><h3 id=\"leveraging-your-results-to-land-your-new-job\">Leveraging Your Results To Land Your New Job</h3><p>There you have it — a step-by-step plan to build the experience you need to land a join a different industry. Now it’s time to get out there and get your foot in there door.</p><p>First up, edit the resume.</p><h4 id=\"add-your-experience-to-your-resume\">Add Your Experience To Your Resume</h4><p>As soon as you have some concrete results under your belt, you’re going to want to add them straight at the top of your resume.</p><p>This will be the first thing that your potential employer will see and it helps remove any doubt about your qualifications.</p><p>Way back up at the top of the article we took a look at why companies hire. The qualifications of X years is just an arbitrary number set by the company to make them feel like they are hiring someone who can do the job.</p><p>Adding in your freelance experience not only shows that you can do the job, but also that you have an understanding of how to run a business. This knowledge is extremely valuable to an employer, especially for a technical hire because technical folks typically get tunnel vision and have trouble seeing how their work relates to the larger picture — making money.</p><p>Here is a screenshot of my consulting experience on my resume:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/xM4oFRc8BjKjr-fpW8-6KWSlzgJcG-qCWz2l\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"xM4oFRc8BjKjr-fpW8-6KWSlzgJcG-qCWz2l\" width=\"800\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h4 id=\"identify-influencers-at-your-target-company\"><strong>Identify Influencers At Your Target Company</strong></h4><p>Now that you have the relevant experience, you’re going to want to start connecting with influencers who can help refer you into your dream job.</p><p>I outline that exact process in my article <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-you-can-land-a-6-figure-job-in-tech-with-no-connections-6eed0de26ea4#.n25pxtah1\" rel=\"noopener\">How To Land A 6-Figure Job In Tech With No Connections</a> so be sure to check that out when you’re ready.</p><h3 id=\"want-more-advice-about-landing-your-dream-job\"><strong>Want More Advice About Landing Your Dream Job?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/guide/\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to sign up for my free newsletter and start taking your career from 0–100 real quick.</a></p><p>For more career advice like this, check out my blog at <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Cultivated Culture.</a></p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

chasing something many people want but few ever get: a job they love.</p><p>I left school with a biology degree and a job in the medical field. It took me about two weeks to realize I absolutely hated it.</p><p>I was working 6 days a week, waking up at 3:30am in order to be at the hospital by 5:30. Making next to nothing, I quickly racked up $10,000 in credit card debt. I knew I deserved more, but I had no idea how to get it.</p><p>I saw people in my graduating class living in New York or San Francisco, making six figure salaries and going on exotic trips. I often wondered what they had figured out that I hadn’t. What was their secret?</p><p>I dedicated the next 12 months of my life to finding the answer. In this article I’m going to share everything I learned along the way.</p><p>First, I’ll walk you through the exact process you can use to get a job interview at your dream company even if you don’t know a single person there — you won’t even need to apply online.</p><p>Next, I’ll teach you how to ace the interview process, get the offer, and land a salary you deserve.</p><p>I personally used these exact strategies to get interviews and offers at companies like Google, Uber and Twitter. They are also the same tactics that <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com\" rel=\"noopener\">my students have used to land interviews and offers at Google, Microsoft, Slack, Deloitte, PWC, American Express, ESPN and more</a>.</p><h3 id=\"referrals-are-the-most-effective-way-to-get-hired\">Referrals Are The Most Effective Way To Get Hired</h3><p>A recent LinkedIn survey on talent trends showed that <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-tips/talent-trends-2015\" rel=\"noopener\">1 in 3 people were actively looking for new work</a>. As of January 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/192361/unadjusted-monthly-number-of-full-time-employees-in-the-us/\" rel=\"noopener\">population of employed people in the United States was 123 million</a>. This means that, at any given time, 41 million people are looking for work.</p><p>On average, an <a href=\"https://www.eremedia.com/ere/why-you-cant-get-a-job-recruiting-explained-by-the-numbers/\" rel=\"noopener\">open role at a well known company gets ~250 resumes</a>. 75% of these resumes came from some sort of online portal (like the company’s online application, or a career aggregator site like Indeed.com).</p><p>Once submitted, these applications are screened by Applicant Tracking software that scans them for keywords. At the end of the process, ~5 resumes make it into the hands of a recruiter. That’s 2% at best.</p><p>Additionally, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> published an article stating that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323869604578368733437346820\" rel=\"noopener\">80% of jobs aren’t advertised online</a>.</p><p>That means that 75% of people applying for jobs are all competing for 20% of the opportunities!</p><p>Oops.</p><p>When it comes to getting hired, referrals are the most effective way to secure an interview and land the offer. Here are some stats from <a href=\"http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/infographic-employee-referrals-hire/\" rel=\"noopener\">a recent Jobvite survey</a>:</p><ul><li>40% of hires come from referrals, the next largest channel is via career sites at 21% (almost half as many)</li><li>Referrals get hired in an average of 3 weeks while other applicants take up to 7 weeks</li><li>Referrals get paid more on average than cold applicants</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/DeFXEUAbpv-PupkxlveuGOfg-jkbuzrgQ1Ye\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"DeFXEUAbpv-PupkxlveuGOfg-jkbuzrgQ1Ye\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>40% of hires come from referrals (courtesy of Jobvite.com)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, over <a href=\"http://julliengordon.com/50-job-search-statistics-successful-job-seekers-need-know\" rel=\"noopener\">50% of six figure jobs are filled via referral</a>.</p><p>Moral of the story? If we want to get hired at our dream job, we need to find another way to get a referral from an insider.</p><p>The problem is, many of us don’t happen to have friends or family working at places like Google.</p><h3 id=\"part-1-how-to-get-a-job-interview-when-you-don-t-know-a-single-person-at-the-company\">Part 1: How To Get A Job Interview When You Don’t Know A Single Person At The Company</h3><h3 id=\"know-your-role-and-find-it-\">Know Your Role (And Find It)</h3><p>The first step is having a solid idea of the specific role you are looking for, down to the company and title if possible.</p><p>Next, you need to make sure that role is available. For today, let’s assume that you want to be an Account Manager in the Technology B2B vertical at Google. Looks like a spot is open in New York:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/pLm8QKvhHYZAWkXXtGT943dvHWMmlIdu5Iwt\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"pLm8QKvhHYZAWkXXtGT943dvHWMmlIdu5Iwt\" width=\"468\" height=\"152\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"locate-potential-influencers\">Locate Potential Influencers</h3><p>Next, you are going to find someone who not only knows about the role, but could potentially have an impact on hiring for it. Time to fire up LinkedIn.</p><p>In the search bar, plug in the company name + all of the information I highlighted above (title, vertical/industry, preferred city). However, before you hit “Search,” we need to remember that you are looking for someone who can influence the hiring process.</p><p>With that in mind, I usually use a title that is one level up from the position that I’m looking for.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with title hierarchy structures in the corporate world, here is a quick guide (if you are already familiar with how titles are structured, feel free to skip this section):</p><h3 id=\"side-note-a-brief-guide-to-company-organizational-structures-by-title\"><strong>Side Note: A Brief Guide To Company Organizational Structures By Title</strong></h3><p>Every company has a hierarchy starting at the top with the CEO/Founder all the way down to the entry level employees. When researching companies, especially people to speak to within those companies, it helps to know where certain titles fit in the food chain. That way you can ensure you are talking to the right person.</p><p>Here is a general list of titles that fits almost any company, starting at the top:</p><ul><li><strong>C-­Level (CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, etc.)</strong></li><li><strong>Vice President (VP)</strong></li><li><strong>Director</strong></li><li><strong>Senior Manager</strong></li><li><strong>Manager</strong></li><li><strong>Coordinator </strong>(Entry Level)</li></ul><h4 id=\"associates-executives-and-seniors\"><em>Associates, Executives, and Seniors</em></h4><p>In many companies, the above titles have some sort of variation that allows for greater segmentation within that level. The most common forms of this are Associate, Executive, and Senior. Here is what those mean:</p><p><strong>Associate: </strong>this title is usually given to someone who is halfway between positions for some reason (maybe there is typically a 4 year gap between levels and they are 2 years in). A person with Associate in their title is usually one notch below a person with the original title. For example, an Associate Account Manager would most likely be one level below an Account Manager.</p><p><strong>Senior: </strong>­this title is the more experienced version of an Associate. People with Senior in their title are usually one notch above the original title. For example, a Senior Account Manager would be one notch above an Account Manager.</p><p><strong>Executive: ­</strong>this title is usually given to people who are very senior, or around the level of Vice President. The two most common cases are Sales Executive/Account Executive (synonymous terms for a senior salesperson) or Executive Vice President who is two notches above a Vice President and one notch above a Senior Vice President. That should be all the info you need to make an educated decision around where people stand within the company you are researching.</p><p>Now that you’re familiar with the company structure, let’s get back to finding that influencer who can help you land this job.</p><p>Since we are looking for an <em>Account Manager </em>role, the next step up would be <em>Senior Account Manager</em> so your LinkedIn search would look like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/FC4y36YZzHmg3RgIdPnDiQf61jxasbI51cMF\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"FC4y36YZzHmg3RgIdPnDiQf61jxasbI51cMF\" width=\"456\" height=\"36\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Our first result? A Senior Account Manager who works in B2B at Google:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/VBuykbVLdpzupEVBdx7uXRpO1qW0EVNcUlGC\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"VBuykbVLdpzupEVBdx7uXRpO1qW0EVNcUlGC\" width=\"800\" height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"obtaining-contact-info\">Obtaining Contact Info</h3><p>Now we’re going to reach out and set up a meeting. It’s best to do these in person but over the phone can work well if you’re dream job is in another state or country.</p><p>In order to get in touch with our influencer, we’re going to need their contact info. Here are 3 strategies you can use to find almost anyone’s corporate email address:</p><h4 id=\"linkedin\"><strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong></h4><p>This one is obvious but it’s a big time saver and definitely worth the 10 seconds it takes to check.</p><p>On the person’s profile, right under their picture, there can be a button labeled “Contact Info” (I say “can be” because people have the option to remove it). Occasionally, people will have their email address listed right there — voila!</p><p>If not, let’s move right along…</p><h4 id=\"reverse-lookup\"><strong><em>Reverse Lookup</em></strong></h4><p>Head over to <a href=\"http://voilanorbert.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Voila Norbert</a> and enter the first and last name of the person you are searching for, as well as their company’s website. For example, if we were trying to find Larry Page’s email, our form would look like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/9Ia9edMTew80Gi98mniPRxsDX9J0KXgCCQaC\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"9Ia9edMTew80Gi98mniPRxsDX9J0KXgCCQaC\" width=\"800\" height=\"138\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Once it spits out their email you can confirm it using <a href=\"http://mailtester.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">MailTester</a>.</p><h4 id=\"matching-formats\"><strong><em>Matching Formats</em></strong></h4><p>If that doesn’t work, you can try finding someone else’s email at the company and use that format reverse engineering your target email address.</p><p>For example, using Larry Page again, if I know that my buddy John Smith’s email is j<strong>ohn at google.com</strong> then I can assume that Larry’s email is <strong>larry at google.com</strong>.</p><p>The easiest way to get a hold of a company email address is to reach out to someone in sales or media because both of these departments usually have inbound lead forms and people on the other end ready to pounce on those leads.</p><p>We can also use our LinkedIn method here and target salespeople.</p><p>Salespeople almost always have their corporate email listed on their LinkedIn because it’s a free win for them. If someone is looking for their product and then finds them on LinkedIn, boom — they just got an effortless inbound lead.</p><p>Once you have the format, you can use <a href=\"http://mailtester.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">MailTester</a> to confirm your target email address.</p><h3 id=\"research-research-research\">Research, Research, Research</h3><p>Now that you have your potential influencer, it’s time to do some research so you can effectively reach out and build that relationship.</p><p>Start with the usual suspects — LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. and look for common points of interest. To be honest, most people are better at this online research thing than I am, so I’ll get back to the meat here.</p><p>One thing I will say is, don’t skimp. The more you get to know this person beforehand, the better your chances of landing a referral from them.</p><p>Some people have said to me, <em>“Austin, isn’t this a little weird? I feel like I’m kind of stalking this person.”</em> I totally get it. However, this information is critical for quickly building a strong relationship and getting that referral.</p><p>Also, in my experience, people tend to expect that you’ve done some research on them. The key is to understand what is kosher to bring up out of the blue and what isn’t.</p><p>People are OK with you checking out their LinkedIn, but they may be a little weirded out if you mention that picture from Saturday’s Bar Crawl you saw on Facebook.</p><p>My general rule of thumb is this: if it exists on LinkedIn, it’s fair game to bring up. If you found it somewhere else (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) use a different method. For example, if I see that my influencer is a skiing fanatic, I may bring up that I went on a ski trip a few weeks beforehand.</p><h3 id=\"sending-the-email\">Sending The Email</h3><p>Now that you have your potential influencer and their contact info, it’s time to reach out. Not only is this one of the scarier parts of this process, it is also the most pivotal.</p><p>To help you get past that hump, I’ve included the exact email script that I used to reach out to people. In this case, I’m reaching out to Tim who works at Google:</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Quick Question</p><p><em>Hi Tim,</em></p><p><em>My name is Austin and I currently work at Cultivated Culture. I was browsing through LinkedIn and came across your information — I hope you don’t mind me reaching out of the blue here.</em></p><p><em>I saw that you have extensive experience in Google’s Technology B2B vertical and I’m very interested in learning more about that space. I would love to have the opportunity to run some questions by you, as well as tap into any advice you may have given your knowledge of the industry.</em></p><p><em>I know that your time is extremely valuable so please don’t feel to need to respond in depth. If you do have 5 minutes to chat, I would really appreciate it.</em></p><p><em>Best,</em></p><p><em>Austin</em></p><p>There are a few key points to the email above:</p><ul><li>Address the person you are emailing by name</li><li>State who you are and make it personable</li><li>Include some flattery that positions the person as an “expert”</li></ul><p>As for the subject, Fast Company did a study where <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3036672/hit-the-ground-running/what-we-learned-from-sending-1000-cold-emails\" rel=\"noopener\">they emailed 1,000 C-level executives from Fortune &amp; Inc 500 companies</a>. They found that the subject line “Quick Question” made up 66.7% of total replies. I saw similar results.</p><p>All of that said, this script is just a framework. You will most likely need to tweak your emails to fit the situation.</p><p>When that time comes, I recommend checking out Sam Parr’s incredible guide on <a href=\"http://kopywritingkourse.com/heres-how-to-cold-email-like-a-boss/\" rel=\"noopener\">how to cold email like a boss</a> (Sam has started conversations with Jeff Bezos and Brian Lee (aka Jessica Alba’s Honest co-founder) via cold email). It’s the same guide I used to help craft my email templates.</p><p>Finally, you want to make sure to send your email at the right time.

The goal of your meeting is to position your influencer as an expert, make them feel special, and build a relationship.</p><p>You <strong>should not</strong> and <strong>will not</strong> mention anything about the opening at their company. People innately enjoy helping others and if you follow the steps above, they will bring this up naturally.</p><p>You will want to prepare a list of questions that gets them to open up about themselves and the company. I like to ask them several softballs to get things warmed up and then hit them with a few questions they are guaranteed to remember.</p><p>Here is a quick set that I’ve had success with in the past (I’ve found the last one really seems to stick):</p><ol><li>I saw you worked at <em>[Previous Companies]</em>. How did you end up going from <em>[First Industry]</em> to becoming interested in <em>[Current Company]</em>?</li><li>You hear a lot about <em>[Current Company]</em> in the news, but I’d love to hear more about why you love working there. What’s your favorite part?</li><li>What is one totally unexpected lesson you’ve learned from working at <em>[Current Company]</em>?</li></ol><h3 id=\"the-million-dollar-question\">The “Million Dollar” Question</h3><p>Regardless of the questions you choose, there is one that you must always be sure to ask:</p><p><em>“What is the biggest challenge your team is facing right now?”</em></p><p>Really dig in here, get them to be specific. This information is going to be critical in helping you land a referral from this person, as well as getting the offer farther down the road.</p><h3 id=\"your-homework-adding-value-in-a-big-way-\">Your Homework: Adding Value (In A Big Way)</h3><p>Okay, so you met with your influencer, things went great, <em>and</em> you identified a major pain point that the team is having. Now we’re going to focus on that last piece.</p><p>Over the next week you are going to research the crap out of your influencer’s problem. Then you are going to come up with a solution and draft up a proposal for how you would solve it. Your proposal should include:</p><ul><li>A summary of the problem (to illustrate that you understand their pain)</li><li>A step-by-step framework of how you would solve this problem</li><li>A brief outline of how your skill set positions you as an asset to implement that solution</li></ul><p>Truthfully, this process deserves a post of its own but this should give you a good idea of what you need to do.

If you’ve never hired on Upwork before, <a href=\"http://blog.hubstaff.com/how-to-hire-on-upwork/\" rel=\"noopener\">here is an amazing guide by Dave Nevogt</a> on how to do it right.</p><h3 id=\"following-up-with-your-proposal\">Following Up With Your Proposal</h3><p>Now we’re going to reach back out to our influencer with the proposal. Here’s the template I used:</p><p><em>Hi [Influencer],</em></p><p><em>Thanks again for taking the time out to chat last week.</em></p><p><em>I spent a lot of time thinking about what you said regarding [team’s biggest challenge]. In fact, I created a short framework that should help you solve it. Please find that attached.</em></p><p><em>If you have some time, I would love to chat about it in more detail.</em></p><p><em>Please let me know if you have any questions, I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts!</em></p><p><em>Best,</em></p><p><em>Austin</em></p><p>It’s very important that you <strong>do not</strong> mention the open position in any of your emails or the proposal. Be patient and wait for their response. When they do get back to you, they will not only bring up the opening but they will ask you if you’re interested.</p><p>Kindly accept and play it cool. You’re in!</p><h3 id=\"part-2-how-to-breeze-through-the-interview-process\">Part 2: How To Breeze Through The Interview Process</h3><p>Fast forward — our influencer passed along our resume to HR and they have reached out to set up a phone screen. Once we get past that, we’ll be on to interviewing with the team, and then getting the job.</p><p><strong>A note to developers:</strong> The advice below does not cover technical interviews, which are typically required for developer/software roles. However, the advice below will help create more time to prepare for technical interviews by minimizing the amount of preparation needed for other parts of the interview process. If you are applying for a development role, I suggest you read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Cracking The Coding Interview</em></a> by <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-you-can-land-a-6-figure-job-in-tech-with-no-connections-6eed0de26ea4/undefined\" rel=\"noopener\">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a>.</p><h3 id=\"-insert-company-name-interview-template\">[Insert Company Name] Interview Template</h3><p>Interviews can be daunting, especially at companies like Google, Amazon, or Uber. I’m sure you’ve read the horror stories about crazy questions they ask people like “Quick — How many golf balls can fit inside a school bus,” or, “how many gas stations are there in Manhattan?”</p><p>The truth is, most of these companies have done away with those questions. They crunched the numbers and found that the answers didn’t correlate with high employee performance (shocker, I know). In fact, Google’s own Senior Vice President of People Operations <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;adxnnlx=1372090093-kzVO2qunZG+IlY9sYUxzBg\" rel=\"noopener\">called them a “complete waste of time.”</a></p><p>These companies have since reverted back to the standard style of interviews, which is great for us because it makes it much easier to identify patterns. We can essentially “guess” what questions will be on the test and prepare answers that will blow our interviewers away (it works way better than it did in college, I swear).</p><p>Here is the process I used to prepare for each one.</p><h3 id=\"nailing-the-basics-questions-you-ll-get-in-every-interview\">Nailing The Basics: Questions You’ll Get In Every Interview</h3><p>According to renowned career guru <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-you-can-land-a-6-figure-job-in-tech-with-no-connections-6eed0de26ea4/undefined\" rel=\"noopener\">Penelope Trunk</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/04/02/five-ways-to-do-better-in-phone-interview/\" rel=\"noopener\">one of the easiest ways to be a better interviewer is to prepare for the most obvious questions</a>. You may be saying “well duh,” but you’d be surprised by how many people spread themselves too thin by trying to prepare answers to every possible question.</p><p>99% of the interviews you go on will follow the exact same template. If you can master the format, your confidence will skyrocket and you’ll be prepared for almost any situation you get thrown into.</p><p><strong>The Universal Job Interview Format:</strong></p><ol><li>Tell me about yourself (your experience, why you are interested in this role, etc.)</li><li>A mix of behavioral questions, which we’ll dive into shortly</li><li>What questions do you have for me (the interviewer)?</li></ol><p>Let’s tackle each individually.</p><h3 id=\"tell-me-about-yourself\">Tell Me About Yourself</h3><p>This is your first impression. More importantly, it’s the only part of the interview that you totally control. Do NOT rattle off your resume like a grocery list.</p><p>In order to nail this part you need to craft an interesting story — your story. You want it to be concise (around 2–3 minutes) and you need to think about what you want to convey. I recommend:</p><ul><li>Choosing 2–3 themes to build your story around (for me, those themes were <em>Persistence</em>, <em>Agility</em>, and <em>Success)</em></li><li>Including quantitative metrics whenever possible</li><li>Addressing the question of why you want to leave your current position (they are going to ask you this anyways, addressing it early shows that you’re aware it’s a concern of theirs and helps put them at ease)</li></ul><p>To help get you started, here is what my story looked like. To give you some context, I was a biology major who was interested in landing a job in digital marketing:</p><p><em>Growing up, like most people, I wanted to be a doctor. I went to [college] where I majored in biology and planned my course to medical school. Not long after, I decided that pre-med wasn’t for me. I wanted to get into digital marketing, and I wanted to be in New York. I set my sights on this goal and created a plan that would get me there.</em></p><p><em>In 2013, I graduated with my biology degree and took a job in medical device sales where I worked from 5:30am — 12:30pm covering surgical cases in the operating room. Then, every day, I would come home and study digital marketing until 8:00pm. In order to gain relevant experience, I got certified in Google Analytics &amp; AdWords and created my own consulting firm that focused on using search engine marketing to generate leads for private golf communities. We were able to increase home sales by an average of 20% while reducing the cost per lead by around 10%. Armed with my new credentials, I began to look for positions in New York.</em></p><p><em>Eventually, I was offered a position at my current company (a promotional analytics company in New York). During my tenure there I have grown my book of business by 467%, spearheaded the creation of an internal group dedicated to marketing the company on the internet, and helped close the second largest deal in company history.</em></p><p><em>However, the company has restructured several times since I was brought on. I’ve had 3 different managers over the past year, as well as 3 titles with different sets of responsibilities. I’m looking for something a bit more stable and [company I am interviewing at] has been somewhere that I have wanted to work since I got into this industry. I’m really excited to have this opportunity.</em></p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: You are <em>telling a story</em>. Don’t be afraid to embellish a bit. I’m not saying you should lie or make up stories, but you want to sell yourself and you can bet your butt that your competition isn’t afraid to inflate their credentials.</p><h3 id=\"behavioral-questions\">Behavioral Questions</h3><p>Next up is the dreaded set of behavioral questions. The ones meant to tease out your thought process and your ability to be a “team player.” This is the part where our educated “guesses” are going to come in handy.</p><p>The behavioral section is broken down into two parts that I call <em>Standard Questions</em> and <em>Company Specific Questions</em>. Let’s start with the former.</p><h4 id=\"standard-questions\"><strong><em>Standard Questions</em></strong></h4><p>You are going to be asked a variation of one, if not all, of these questions in every single interview you go to:</p><ol><li>Why do you want to work for us?</li><li>Tell me about a time you exhibited leadership</li><li>Tell me about a time where you had to work as a team</li><li>Tell me about a time you’ve had to work with a difficult person, or difficult people</li><li>Tell me about a time you failed</li><li>Tell me about a time you overcame an obstacle</li><li>Tell me about a time when you had success</li></ol><p>If you can answer these 6 questions, you can handle 9 out of 10 interviews with no other preparation and be totally fine. Just follow the same set of rules I mentioned above in the <em>Tell Me About Yourself</em> section:</p><ul><li>Craft a concise story</li><li>Make sure to include quantitative metrics that illustrate your success</li><li>Anticipate and address objections</li></ul><h4 id=\"company-specific-questions\"><strong><em>Company Specific Questions</em></strong></h4><p>These are questions that fall in the middle of the 7 listed above and “why are man hole covers round?” Never fear though, we can anticipate these too.</p><p>Head over to <a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">GlassDoor</a>. If you’ve never heard of GlassDoor, it’s a great resource for any job seeker that includes salaries, reviews, and interview information for almost any company in the world.</p><p>First, you are going to search for the position you’re applying for. In keeping with our theme, we’ll search for “Google” under Companies &amp; Reviews:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/s-IoIK7XrqfHryqsm0yu6gfexzPgc1FPV7Ja\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"s-IoIK7XrqfHryqsm0yu6gfexzPgc1FPV7Ja\" width=\"632\" height=\"213\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Next, we’re going to click on the “Interviews” Tab:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/d6dUDnY5jKISD4c99ApGHfWhag-NhDOyf-Zt\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"d6dUDnY5jKISD4c99ApGHfWhag-NhDOyf-Zt\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Then scroll down and click on “Filter Interviews” which will bring up some advanced settings. Here we’ll type in the title of the job we want (Account Manager, in this case) and the location (New York, NY). We’ll also select “Received Offer” because the people who didn’t receive offers tend to be slightly, <em>ahem</em>, biased:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/295Bl9ZAPy4Lt0zMnP3zF6KvImRS7aI0xA36\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"295Bl9ZAPy4Lt0zMnP3zF6KvImRS7aI0xA36\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This will pull up a list of reviews from everyone who interviewed and received an offer for that position. The general comments are really helpful, but we want to focus on a section called <em>Interview Questions</em> towards the bottom. I usually comb through 10–15 of these and add all of the interview questions into a Word doc so I can answer them later:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/CvwahTxPZJ7JBV6GSKpSNczp8OTKIY84gIkA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"CvwahTxPZJ7JBV6GSKpSNczp8OTKIY84gIkA\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Now you have your second set of questions to prepare for.</p><h3 id=\"what-questions-do-you-have-for-me\">What Questions Do You Have For Me?</h3><p>Finally, once they are done peppering you with questions, your interviewer will ask if you have any questions for them. <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-you-should-ask-questions-at-your-next-tech-company-interview-5070384dc5a0\" rel=\"noopener\">This is the most crucial part of the interview</a>.</p><p>Why? Because so many people neglect it. If you can ask some questions that are even slightly outside of the box, I’ve found that really sticks with the interviewer more than any other part of the meeting.</p><p>After every interview I’ve been on, I asked for feedback. Without fail, the interviewer made a positive comment about the questions I asked. The good news for you is that I asked the same exact questions in every single one. Here they are:</p><ul><li>What is your favorite part about working here?</li><li>What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now?</li><li>Let’s say that, in one year, you are looking back on this hire. What has that person done to exceed expectations on every level?</li><li>Ask about a current event (for example — I saw that <em>[Competitor X] </em>came out with this product. How do you see that affecting your business?)</li><li>What is the most unexpected lesson you’ve learned while working at [company]?</li><li>Tell me a little bit more about you, what do you like to do outside of work?</li></ul><p>These questions work because they are based on specific principles of behavioral psychology. They break down barriers and help build a positive association in your interviewer’s mind. If you’re interested in the details, you can <a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/5-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview/\" rel=\"noopener\">read more about it here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"say-thank-you\">Say Thank You</h3><p>While we’re on the subject, be absolutely sure to send a thank you note to everyone you interviewed with. Also include a personal touch to each one (something that you gained from that last question).</p><p>Many people I talk to say <em>“but I don’t have their email.”</em> Ask for it! At the end of every interview always, <strong>always</strong> ask for a business card or write down the person’s email in your notebook.</p><p>If you forget, try using the techniques I outlined above for finding people’s emails and you should be fine.</p><h3 id=\"part-3-following-up-what-to-do-if-they-say-no\">Part 3 — Following Up &amp; What To Do If They Say No</h3><p>This is one of the most common mistakes I see from job applicants. I understand how nerve wracking it is to sit there and wait while everything is completely out of your hands.</p><p>One of the toughest things I had to learn throughout my interview process was that, while this is a HUGE deal to you, it’s really just another agenda item on the hiring manager’s schedule.</p><p>They will get back to you, and if they don’t? You don’t want to work for someone who doesn’t have the courtesy of replying to the people they do business with.</p><h3 id=\"when-can-i-send-them-a-reminder\">When Can I Send Them A Reminder?</h3><p>The rule of thumb is one business week. If you interviewed on a Tuesday, wait until the next Tuesday to email them (as <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-you-can-land-a-6-figure-job-in-tech-with-no-connections-6eed0de26ea4/undefined\" rel=\"noopener\">J.T. O'Donnell</a> says, <a href=\"http://www.careerealism.com/email-unanswered-follow-up/\" rel=\"noopener\">never send a nudge on a Monday</a>). When you do, don’t push or be blunt. Keep it short and sweet:</p><p><em>Hi [Interviewer],</em></p><p><em>I hope you had a great week!</em></p><p><em>I wanted to quickly follow up and see if there was anything else I could help with regarding the application process. If so, please let me know.</em></p><p><em>Best,</em></p><p><em>Austin</em></p><p>That’s it. If they don’t respond to that after another 3–4 days, you have your answer and it’s time to move on.</p><h3 id=\"what-happens-if-they-say-no\">What Happens If They Say No?</h3><p>Ugh. The worst case scenario. Don’t get down just yet though, we’re not done here.</p><p>I have this quality where I have trouble taking “no” as an answer. When I was interviewing with Google, the initial screener told me that she wasn’t going to put me through because she “didn’t think I was qualified, and didn’t want to waste the team’s time.”</p><p>I was not happy. So I sent her this:</p><p><em>Hi [Recruiter],</em></p><p><em>Thank you again for carving out the time to speak this afternoon. I really appreciate your feedback, and I wanted to add one final note:</em><br> <br><em>I completely understand your concerns regarding my experience with [skill]. You are correct that I didn’t have much experience with that at [previous company]. That said, this doesn’t stem from an inability to produce results, but rather a lack of opportunity to do so.</em></p><p><em>While my experience on paper may not match up to the initial expectations of the position’s description, I have do have two qualities that work in my favor: I am an extremely efficient learner, and am also very effective at translating those learnings into practice. Second, I’m much more tenacious than your average individual. My career has hinged on these two qualities. </em><br> <br><em>I left college with no digital experience and a biology degree — all of my digital knowledge was obtained through self study. I spent 8 months selling myself without the on-paper experience to back it up. When I was finally given the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a business setting, I playing a critical role in landing the company’s 2nd largest deal in history. I am confident that I can have the same success in this role. I have the resources necessary to learn what I need in order to be successful at [company], and am prepared to do whatever it takes to make that happen.</em><br> <br><em>I understand that [company’s] interview process is extremely challenging, and that only the top talent ends up with an offer letter at the end. I also believe that I am worthy of a shot at that letter. [Company] is known for hiring people who excel at the intangibles, as well the ability to learn new things and apply them to existing knowledge. That is my forte.</em><br> <br><em>I am not asking for an offer. I am simply asking for the opportunity to speak with the hiring manager to make my case for the position. I’m sure you will find the best person for the position, I would just like to have a legitimate shot at being that person. If you give me that chance, my next set of answers will not disappoint.</em><br> <br><em>Thank you again for your continued consideration.</em><br><em>Best,</em></p><p><em>Austin</em></p><p>Now that may be a little aggressive…</p><p>Ok, it was pretty aggressive. But she wrote me back an hour later and pushed me through to the next round! Mission accomplished.</p><p>The moral of the story here is, don’t give up if you get a “No.” Try to identify why you were turned down and then send a note to hiring manager addressing those items (feel free to copy mine).</p><h3 id=\"taking-action\">Taking Action</h3><p>There you have it.
