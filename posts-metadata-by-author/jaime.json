That’s when he came across 3D printing, and one of the fastest-growing 3D printing companies in the world was born. &nbsp;</p><p>Today, I’m going to show you exactly how Prusa3D became one of the fastest-growing hardware manufacturers in Europe. Then you can take inspiration from their exact strategy to grow a hardware company and create a community of contributors who will help you develop and promote your project with close to no resources.</p><h2 id=\"some-background-on-prusa\">Some background on Prusa</h2><p>Josef Prusa, Prusa Research’s founder, is a superstar in the 3D printers industry.</p><p>You might have already heard about him but if you haven’t…</p><ul><li>Prusa Research was founded as a one-man startup in 2012 by Josef Prusa.</li><li>His goal with Prusa Research was to create a kind of Thermomix, Europe's favourite all-in-one, easy-to-use kitchen appliance, for 3D printing. He wanted to make a 3D printer that was easy enough that anyone could use it, with guidance on steps and materials.</li><li>In 2018 Prusa Research became the fastest-growing tech company in Central Europe (Deloitte Fast 50 2018) after growing <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/cz/en/pages/press/articles/technology-fast-500-emea-v-top-petce-hned-dve-ceske-firmy.html\">17,118%</a> between 2014 and 2018</li><li>Prusa Research has grown from humble beginnings to selling 100,000 printers, employing over 410 employees, and setting up a factory in Prague with 9 floors and a hackerspace on the ground floor</li><li>The company brought the Maker Faire to Prague for the first time</li><li>Prusa’s website has over one million unique visitors per month, its YouTube Channel has more than 144,000 subscribers, and its forum has over 143,000 members</li></ul><p>Josef Prusa was lucky, but also did a lot of things well that we can all learn from.</p><p>How? Let’s dive in.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-solve-a-problem-of-your-own-give-back-and-build-trust-in-growing-communities\">How to solve a problem of your own, give back, and build trust in growing communities</h1><p>Before the roller coaster started, Josef enrolled in an economics degree to make his parents proud. This resulted in a lot of spare time, so he and his brother began DJing and building their music controllers. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9dMtMOFCRV1bZ_HecTpH2gEA6qBHOlDU4DuxyfWHP7JZ8r6a7sZP3uGPvYJbST1Ag1P4Glpe6z8mZYcV91ocvM8SIHWGUUVOmu7kgEnIQMFNtxxfwztHguIZbBU7pKmO_CTtzQsG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"9dMtMOFCRV1bZ_HecTpH2gEA6qBHOlDU4DuxyfWHP7JZ8r6a7sZP3uGPvYJbST1Ag1P4Glpe6z8mZYcV91ocvM8SIHWGUUVOmu7kgEnIQMFNtxxfwztHguIZbBU7pKmO_CTtzQsG\" width=\"733\" height=\"478\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>Josef (above), rocking his DJ skills. Little did he know how his life was about to change.</em></p><p>He was looking to make his own knobs and faders, but found the search into it too long and challenging. He then found the RepRap project and Mendel 3D printer.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/E1aDCM352WrnBfNzyFNcUm5OAkmqSPXr-qk_99hlG4oX8lkTxuwb6VnrupN2LoZCW5I3Ml2uxtnMXkQGkDy384h4KIAyhWehZxCWu7djASy2Jnm3z5dtaISi93SAT5KYkKtUOny_\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"E1aDCM352WrnBfNzyFNcUm5OAkmqSPXr-qk_99hlG4oX8lkTxuwb6VnrupN2LoZCW5I3Ml2uxtnMXkQGkDy384h4KIAyhWehZxCWu7djASy2Jnm3z5dtaISi93SAT5KYkKtUOny_\" width=\"723\" height=\"398\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>As you may know, RepRap is a community project started by Doctor Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath and it kickstarted the desktop 3D printing craze.</p><p>The basic idea is that a 3D printer can print as many parts as possible for another 3D printer and as a result, decreases its cost.</p><p>But when Josef was building his Mendel Printer, he was finding it too complex. It required many different screw sizes, there were no slots for nuts, and very few parts were push-to-fit.</p><p>So he improved the Mendel by making a simpler version; the Simplified Mendel [sic], and shared the designs on GitHub with the rest of the RepRap community. </p><p>The community caught up with his simplified model and started using it over the original, and that’s when people started noticing him. </p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>If you’re a student, have spare time, and/or have no dependents, enjoy this time to experiment and try new things. What are you curious about building?</li><li>Identify and solve a problem of your own. &nbsp;What tools are you using? What’s currently frustrating you about them?</li><li>Fix or simplify what’s not working. If you don’t know how, what skills would help you? Learn those.</li><li>Share your solution in a community that’s active and that has the same problem. You’ll benefit from exposure and feedback to make your solutions better. This way you’ll start building trust among a like-minded audience and you’ll be in touch with what people want.</li></ul><h1 id=\"how-to-create-your-first-prototype\">How to create your first prototype </h1><p>When Josef was trying to solve his problem, printers were still missing one key component to have the ABS plastic print successful: a heated bed.

It was the first real product he created. </p><p>This new heatbed could reach 110ºC, more than enough for ABS and other high-temperature plastics.</p><p>But many parts of the heatbed were either too expensive or difficult to get, so he redid many on his own. </p><p>He soon started receiving requests to print his Prusa Mendel’s parts. He also organized a few local build events, where everybody could build their own parts. </p><p>There was so much demand that it was time for Josef to officially start Prusa 3D with his brother Michal.</p><p>What’s interesting is that he didn’t start with the company name, the logo, and so on – rather, he started with a problem he had himself, and then he shared publicly, both his problem and his solutions, with others. </p><p>By sharing what he was doing with others, people who had the same problem could order his solution. And there were many people who shared his problem, which translated into many orders.</p><p>It’s also important to appreciate the persistence and patience it takes to continue iterating for six months in order to create a product that works and one that people want to use. </p><p>Josef and his brother began selling their first parts without an e-shop and instead sold them through email and a phone number on a webpage. They also hadn’t perfectly optimized their packaging yet. In the beginning, they packed their heatbeds in a pizza box and shipped them off to their clients.</p><p>Josef and Michal didn’t let the lack of a perfect tech solution get in their way. They simply found a way that was good enough to get their idea out the door and then made it better as they went along.</p><p>They were also proactive in creating awareness and trust with their audience. In the early days, they kickstarted the community by organizing presentations and going to events to educate people about the possibilities of this new 3D printing idea.</p><p>Josef also embodied honesty in his sales. If people came to him but were looking for something he didn’t sell or was a poor fit, he just told them which technology they should use instead. &nbsp;</p><p>This earned him a community of loyal users who trusted him and regularly came back to share prints and hacks on the new Prusa Printer's online hub. Whenever Prusa was criticized in their Youtube comment section, a flock of fans spoke up in their defense. </p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>Start simple before having everything figured out.</li><li>Let go of perfectionism or trying to look like established companies. What is good enough for the stage you’re at to satisfy the needs of the people you can serve? If it’s packaging your products in a pizza box instead of providing a delightful unboxing experience, so be it. If it’s not having an e-shop but just an email and a phone number on a simple website, so be it.</li><li>Focus on creating a solution that solves the problem for good. It might take some time, but if it hasn’t been solved yet, there’s a good chance it’s because it’s hard to solve. Being persistent and patient requires you to commit and invest at the beginning, but once you get through the other side of the problem, you’ll have something people will flock to. It took Josef Prusa six months before he found a proper solution for his heatbed.</li><li>Be radically honest and defend the best interests of your customers. If there is someone else who can serve them better, redirect them there. This builds trust, as people will remember how you treated them with respect.</li></ul><h1 id=\"should-you-do-everything-yourself-or-delegate-certain-tasks\">Should you do everything yourself, or delegate certain tasks?</h1><p>When we start something and it gets some traction, or even if we just anticipate the traction it can get, thinking about everything that we have to deal with can become overwhelming.</p><p>There might be barcode visualization, trademark registration, label design, building walls, building websites, accounting, invoicing, digging drains, dealing with bankers, installing equipment, video-editing, dealing with customer support, and more. </p><p>Most of the time we’re not even remotely competent at more than one or two of those things.</p><p>So this is the time when we hit a fork in the road. Do we hire or outsource to delegate, or do we do it ourselves?</p><p>Prusa’s beginnings are an interesting example of how to go through this period and build for the long term. Below, Josef <a href=\"https://www.tctmagazine.com/additive-manufacturing-3d-printing-news/pushing-prusa/\">explains</a> how they went about preparing to scale:</p><blockquote><em>“We never had resellers so we were always in direct contact with the customers in the community and this proved very important for us because you have instant feedback from the people.</em><br><br><em>If you are just a manufacturer and somebody else is doing the selling for you, you don’t always get all the information back.</em><br><br><em>In the beginning, it was much tougher for us to do it this way because we not only needed to learn how to make the printers at scale but we also needed to learn how to run a big webshop and how to do the customer support for all these people. It was more difficult but now it’s paying off that we have this direct contact and know how to run every part of the business on our own.”</em></blockquote><p>It wasn’t until October 2013, three years after finishing the initial prototype, that they hired their first employee, Hanka.</p><p>How do you get the cash flow to hire people? Well, you sell in advance and produce after. In the beginning, Prusa always had a two week lead time for customers to get a printer. </p><p>As they continued to grow, they also hired a Foxconn engineer to deal with quality and a couple more software engineers to lead the engineering team.</p><p>They could have spent months or years trying to raise funding through VC or Kickstarter in order to hire people, outsource production and grow much faster. </p><p>But they decided instead to invest in the slower and more demanding path of figuring it out on their own, and keeping contact with the customers and their needs. This path has proven to be a much better strategy in the long run. &nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, Prusa Research had a revenue of 149.000€, which then grew to 70 million €, employing over 250 employees in 2019 just by bootstrapping the business.</p><p>If you aim to change the system, you need to be able to exist independently of it. </p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>Embrace DIY and learn to do the critical parts of the business yourself. What skills do you need to learn? Where can you learn them?</li><li>Once you can no longer do it yourself, understand what needs to be done, and when you have enough cash flow, hire people to do the work with you.</li></ul><h1 id=\"what-prusa-stands-for\">What Prusa stands for</h1><p>Prusa has exploded because it does a few things very well by always putting their customers' needs first without compromising their values or their price. This in turn helps them build a strong virtuous cycle for their development.</p><h3 id=\"prusa-has-a-long-term-vision\">Prusa has a long-term vision</h3><p>Josef knows what he wants Prusa to become. He wants his printers to be able to print any object with any material and through guided steps, much like a Thermomix for 3D printing. And he wants the least tech-savvy person to be able to operate it. </p><p>Having this clarity helps him and everyone in the company align their efforts towards a common goal.</p><h3 id=\"they-have-amazing-customer-support\">They have amazing customer support</h3><p>The company also keeps investing in the way it cares for its customers. </p><p>They go to great lengths to test every single part of their printers to ensure quality but even that isn’t enough to cover everything – so that’s why they have support. </p><p>Almost 20% of their employees work in customer support. They have 12,000 live chats per month in nine languages and deal with over 11,000 emails each month.</p><h3 id=\"prusa-provides-high-quality-products\">Prusa provides high quality products </h3><p>Investing in making the designs of their 3D printers more functional, simple, and of high quality allows them to avoid competing with the nicer-looking but more expensive 3D printers.</p><h3 id=\"they-make-an-affordable-printer\">They make an affordable printer </h3><p>This means that they are not too expensive for everyday consumers, and not too cheap for companies. </p><p>They’ve also made their 3D printer upgradable because it saves money for their customers and it builds their clients’ autonomy by helping them learn about the construction of the printer’s hardware. </p><h3 id=\"all-prusa-s-work-is-open-source\">All Prusa's work is open source</h3><p>Prusa’s clients are “normal Joes” as Josef describes them, and most don’t care much about open source. But the company does.</p><p>Those who care about open source provide valuable contributions that can be added back into the products. Some people will make improvements, some will fill in new code, and all of it helps make the printers better. </p><p>The open-source approach is also good for users. Those who want to do modifications find it much simpler because they have the original sources for the printer parts, the firmware, and the electronics.</p><p>Josef even has a tattoo of the OHSWA logo to keep himself accountable and honest to the open source vision.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_HpRsRZxaIgltuy6qV4kPbS--swoExxD1D_6rWsblfLzIzWfRSsEeJqTu2mgNwbMRDSObQDGC5N89_e5MFtc2bt7KWcoo-xFy4vwQVSK2VQ7c_LEYo3Wt4aeFiGV8kA6Z8_3nDIR\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"_HpRsRZxaIgltuy6qV4kPbS--swoExxD1D_6rWsblfLzIzWfRSsEeJqTu2mgNwbMRDSObQDGC5N89_e5MFtc2bt7KWcoo-xFy4vwQVSK2VQ7c_LEYo3Wt4aeFiGV8kA6Z8_3nDIR\" width=\"640\" height=\"469\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/aleph-objects-prusa-research-3d-printing-community-others-react-ultimaker-patent-application-107215/\"><em>3D printing Industry</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Open source makes it easy for the idea to spread and upskill people who can find new use cases to increase the company’s pace of innovation, and it makes it more affordable to its clients.</p><h3 id=\"they-partner-with-distributors-and-support-their-clients-even-though-it-decreases-their-margins\">They partner with distributors and support their clients even though it decreases their margins</h3><p>Another counterintuitive thing Prusa does for its clients is that it supports the customers serviced by other distributors. </p><p>Many companies would forfeit this channel because it demands high margins and the distributors don’t do support. But they do these distribution partnerships anyway to make it easier for the people they serve to discover and access their printers. </p><p>And even if they make no extra money through these channels, they still give them the same level of support as those who buy from their website. </p><p>Why? Because caring for their customers is what makes it safe for them to then recommend Prusa to their friends and family, driving more business by word of mouth. </p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>What is the long term vision of what you’re doing? What happens as you keep developing your organization? What results are you helping people achieve?</li><li>How can you invest in better supporting your customers?</li><li>What parts of your project can you give away for people to build and learn with you?</li><li>What partnerships can you build to distribute your project in places where people need it?</li></ul><h1 id=\"how-prusa-builds-and-invests-in-the-community\">How Prusa Builds and Invests in the Community</h1><p>We’ve already spoken a lot about how much they invest in customer support, but Prusa also invests heavily in their community. </p><p>This does two things: it builds proof of what their product does in the world, and it helps scale even further what their customer support service can do. </p><p>To gather their community they do a few things.</p><p>The first thing Prusa does is offer two options to customers: They can either buy printers as kits or assembled. 80% of clients buy the printers in kits. Besides saving time in production, this allows the clients to learn how to build their printers and understand how they work. </p><p>This approach is raising a generation of makers who can create and fix instead of throw away, building a lot of goodwill for the Prusa brand. </p><p>To keep in touch with the community, in the early days Josef Prusa tried to go to as many shows as possible so that he could talk to fans face to face and hear about the awesome projects that could come to life with the help of their printers. He went to Maker Faires and to DIY or 3D-printing events.</p><p>Now that the company has grown so much, he can’t go to as many events. But before the pandemic started, there was a team of three to ten people traveling around the world two to four times a month. And they were also organizing their Maker Faire in the Czech Republic. </p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>Where are your community members hanging out? What blogs or magazines do they read? What podcasts do they listen to? What events do they go to? What youtube channels do they watch? What newsletters do they subscribe to? Who do they follow on Twitter, Facebook, or Linkedin? What forums or groups do they participate in?</li><li>What resources do they need to get started that you can facilitate? How can you give them the tools to create what you do?</li><li>How can you invite users to participate in the development of your product? Can you open your files and designs for them? How can you invite them to give back and showcase their work or the skills they’re building thanks to you? Where could you use this as proof that your product works?</li></ul><h1 id=\"how-to-engage-the-community\">How to Engage the Community</h1><p>Many people understand the value of giving free stuff away online to attract a crowd. But I feel that many entrepreneurs haven’t embraced the opportunity and the value of connecting the people in their community with each other. </p><p>This is a very powerful idea that can go a long way in building trust and reciprocity with your brand and in getting the community members to spread the word and interact with stories of what you do.</p><p>One more powerful thing that Prusa is doing is figuring out how to connect the isolated Maker tribe, and at scale. </p><p>Once they gather their community by giving away their designs and connecting with them at events, the next challenge is getting these people to engage. And Prusa does a remarkable job at that. </p><p>They’ve created a series of resources that make it easy for people to learn the skills and tools they need to become active members of the community.</p><p>In their online hub, they share resources for learning and practice, such as a library of 3D printing models with files, and free guides on how to start 3D printing. </p><p>Once people are on their website to grab these resources, they can connect with each other locally or online through a map or in the forums to reach out for support or to go for a beer. </p><p>As a quick overview, Prusa provides the resources needed to learn the tools and the skills required to set up and hack a 3D printer. There are manuals, such as a free ebook to teach the basics of 3D printing, assembly instructions in video and ebook form, troubleshooting guides, and of course the downloadable drivers and firmware.</p><p>Once people have what they need to learn the basics, they can jump into the Forum to talk about their printer model, stay up to date with General Announcements and releases, find those community members in the Hall of Fame, and discuss the software.</p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>What resources does your audience need to develop the skills required to use your product and to participate in the community in order to help each other?</li><li>Once they trust you, how can you connect them to find support among their peers? What exchanges can you facilitate or what spaces can you create for them to gather and talk about their questions?</li></ul><h1 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h1><p>Prusa’s approach helped them grow over 17,000% without a sales team, only through word of mouth.</p><p>It helps that they serve the fast-growing 3D printing market, but still.</p><p>Prusa has become a big player and a beloved brand in their industry, proving that &nbsp;you don’t need a huge marketing team or budget to get similar results. You just need a smart and intentional plan.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways you can borrow, modify, and adapt for your own business based on Prusa’s real-life marketing tactics:</p><h3 id=\"takeaway-1-build-a-skill-to-solve-a-problem-of-your-own\">Takeaway #1: Build a skill to solve a problem of your own</h3><p>What tool are you using that is not working as you wish it did? Learn the skills to fix or simplify what’s not working. </p><h3 id=\"takeaway-2-share-your-solution-in-public\">Takeaway #2: Share your solution in public</h3><p>Once you create your first working solution, share it with communities who already use these tools and have the same problem as you do. </p><p>This builds trust, reciprocity, and if people want to buy your solution or they have other problems you can build on, they can tell you.</p><h3 id=\"takeaway-3-if-it-s-your-first-time-be-patient\">Takeaway #3: If it’s your first time, be patient</h3><p>When we first start, we don’t have all the skills we need to find a solution to a problem. Be patient and persistent and embrace failure and rejection. It’s by getting into action that you’ll figure out what’s not working or missing, and what needs adjusting.</p><h3 id=\"takeaway-4-start-simple-even-if-you-don-t-have-everything-figured-out\">Takeaway #4: Start simple, even if you don’t have everything figured out</h3><p>Let go of perfectionism or trying to look like an established company. What is good enough at the stage you’re at to satisfy the needs of the people you can serve? What is good enough for now to solve other people's problems, build your product, and ship it?</p><h3 id=\"takeaway-5-learn-to-do-everything-yourself-and-become-autonomous\">Takeaway #5: Learn to do everything yourself and become autonomous</h3><p>Don’t delegate too soon. If your goal is to change the system, you’ll have to learn to be autonomous early on and stay in close contact with your customers. </p><p>When the time comes to delegate, you’ll know what needs to be done and hire the right people for it. </p><h3 id=\"takeaway-6-be-radically-honest-and-defend-the-interests-of-your-customers\">Takeaway #6: Be radically honest and defend the interests of your customers</h3><p>If there is a competitor who can serve them better, redirect them there. It will build trust as people will remember how you treated them with respect. </p><h3 id=\"takeaway-7-be-clear-on-what-you-stand-for\">Takeaway #7: Be clear on what you stand for</h3><p>What is the long term vision of your project? If money and growth is a means to an end, what is that end meant to achieve? What can you do to accelerate or scale this? </p><p>For Prusa, it was investing in outstanding customer support and sharing their work in open source to create both a delightful experience and to involve outside experts in their innovation.</p><h3 id=\"takeaway-8-find-and-gather-your-community\">Takeaway #8: Find and gather your community</h3><p>Go meet your community where they hang out to stay in touch with their needs and to connect with them. What forums or groups do they participate in? What events do they go to?</p><p>Once you’ve found them, create spaces for them to gather and connect. Josef Prusa started by participating in the RepRap forums and by going to Maker events. Later on, they started organizing their Maker Faire in the Czech Republic.</p><h3 id=\"takeaway-9-engage-the-community\">Takeaway #9: Engage the community</h3><p>Give them the resources and tools they need to get started. Then invite them to participate in the development of your product by opening your designs. </p><p>For those who contribute, you can showcase their work and skills to show your gratitude, and use these contributions also as proof that your product and community work.</p><p>Thanks for reading.

incredible things they’ve achieved:</p><ul><li>Font Awesome has a 20% market share among those websites which use third-party Font Scripts on their platform, ranking it second place after Google Fonts</li><li>They were Github’s most popular new open source project in 2012 and are currently in the top 10 projects overall.</li><li>Font Awesome is on more than 73 million websites. And according to the founder, about 1 in every 3 new website uses Font Awesome.</li><li>And last but not least, by raising $1,076,960, Font Awesome became the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/technology/software?sort=most_funded\" rel=\"noopener\">highest funded software project</a> on Kickstarter and in the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?tag_id=20&amp;sort=most_funded&amp;seed=2554470&amp;page=1\" rel=\"noopener\">top 3 of Open source</a> projects.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*5kirYGnh2rMsBYRL\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*5kirYGnh2rMsBYRL\" width=\"701\" height=\"648\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>It seems Dave Gandy and his team have done a few things right along the way.</p><p>If we’re realistic, very few (if any) of us will ever hit the virality, renown and success Font Awesome has. So will you get anything useful from reading how they made it?</p><p>Very much indeed!</p><p>The good news is that there are some simple and fundamental lessons that you can apply when launching or developing your project to multiply the chances of your idea getting adopted by others.</p><p>Today I’m going to show you exactly how Font Awesome has grown to be used by 20% of the web so you can take inspiration from this EXACT strategy to grow your own projects.</p><p>Want to see how it works?</p><p>Let’s go!</p><h3 id=\"step-0-become-unique\">Step 0: Become Unique</h3><p>Dave Gandy started Font Awesome as a passion project. But he recognises there are better designers and programmers out there. So, if he wasn’t at the top 1% of designers and programmers, how did he make something that could grow beyond projects lead by much better professionals? Well, he just blended skills at which he was at the top 25%.</p><p>Stick with me here.</p><p>Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert, has a <a href=\"http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html\" rel=\"noopener\">great post</a> where he explains how to develop an amazing career:</p><blockquote><em>“If you want an average successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>1. Become the best at one specific thing.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don’t recommend anyone even try.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”</em></blockquote><p>When I read this post, it hit me. That seems to be exactly the strategy Dave Gandy unconsciously followed when he created Font Awesome:</p><blockquote><em>“I am very visually oriented. There are plenty of visual designers much better than me. [And even if] I’m also very technically focused [but there are] people that are much better technically than me. But the intersection for me as an individual is something that doesn’t really exist very often and so this was me playing to my strengths.”</em></blockquote><p>So there you have it. What are your 2–3 skills at which you are at the top 25%? Could you combine those to create something that’s uniquely yours?</p><p>If you don’t have them yet, what are 2–3 skills you’d like to develop? Could they blend to support each other even if you’re not at the top 1% of performers?</p><p>In my case, the blend of skills that bear fruit are knowing how to write and get published in other publications, experience and research in open source community building and business, and a pretty deep knowledge of and experience with business strategy.</p><p>Each of them on their own are nothing to write home about, since they’re relatively abundant elsewhere. But it’s hard to find other people who can provide all of these skills put together.</p><p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>Find which 2 or 3 skills you have that you could mix with your own unique flavor, or go develop those skills that would help you contribute to projects you love or to develop those dreams you have.</li><li>Develop side projects to hone these skills</li><li>Actively show your side projects to others. Once they offer to pay you money for it, you are onto something people really want.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-1-scratch-your-itch-and-contribute-to-an-open-source-rocket\">Step 1: Scratch your itch and contribute to an open source rocket</h3><p>Let’s come back to Dave Gandy. As he was working out on a different startup, he was searching for a set of icons to use on his website. While there were a few decent sets out there, he didn’t like their camera icons. So he started complaining to one of his co-founders how none of these icons looked similar enough to what he was looking for:</p><blockquote>“They were all a pain to use and it was just way too much effort […] so my co-vendor told me to shut up, […] stop bothering him and to just make it myself”.</blockquote><p>So he went on to work on this one icon, and decided to make a whole set.</p><p>Also, for the previous several months he’d been using Twitter Bootstrap and loved it… except for the PNG sprites:</p><blockquote>“They came in only two colors, and I wasn’t crazy about the design. So I decided to make a drop in replacement for Bootstrap’s icons. And since other icon fonts didn’t seem to always play well with screen readers, I wanted to solve that too.”</blockquote><p>This was one of the best decisions he could make. Solve a problem for a platform that was growing very rapidly.</p><p>Of course, you can’t know in advance what is going to grow exponentially, but by being aware of the latest technologies out there, you can get a feel for what’s working and what isn’t. And if you get early on in an Open Source project you can actually solve some of the most salient problems many other people will want solved.</p><p>The next great move they did was making the font free of charge. This made it really smooth for anyone to adopt it and experience it’s awesomeness.</p><p>Why did they do that I hear you ask?</p><p>Here’s Dave’s take on it:</p><blockquote>“Personally, I benefit from open source every day in my life. So making Font Awesome open source was an easy decision for me.”</blockquote><p>So following his personal values and giving back made a lot of business sense. It turned out to be an immense advantage for the overall project and gave it exposure to lots of people willing to pay them to work on Font Awesome.</p><h4 id=\"takeaways-\"><strong>Takeaways:</strong></h4><ul><li>Scratch your itch</li><li>Contribute to cool open projects you like, and solve problems in areas that you think are lacking</li><li>Share your solutions back in open source so that you can benefit from the exposure to the community of the original project. This way you’ll start building your own audience</li><li>Promote on places where the communities are. In case of Font Awesome, they were looking for developers and web designers, so they went to Hacker News.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-2-talk-to-users-to-find-ways-to-make-it-financially-sustainable\">Step 2: Talk to users to find ways to make it financially sustainable</h3><p>Given the great traction Font Awesome experienced, they ended up entering the famous YCombinator. One of the pieces of advice they found most valuable was:</p><blockquote>“Talk to users. There’s no way to know for sure what people want unless you talk to them”.</blockquote><p>Simple, right?</p><p>So they took the advice and went and asked their visitors to fill out a survey about who they were and how they used Font Awesome. 6,000 people completed the in-depth, 45-minute survey. Once the survey was over, there were two key takeaways from the survey: Users wanted more icons, and they preferred the SVG format.</p><p>Learning that people would pay for more icons and a modernized framework using SVG helped Font Awesome build up to their Kickstarter campaign and start to find a path towards sustainability. And this is never an easy task for an open source project.</p><p>Now they have a series of other <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/pricing\" rel=\"noopener\">paid offers</a> from $60/year to get additional services beyond the open source icons, like a dedicated CDN service (a distributed group of servers to provide fast delivery of Internet content) to get icons to load faster, editable SVGs, even more new icons and new icon packs.</p><p>And they are also making money by serving ads through <a href=\"https://carbonads.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">Carbon</a>’s service to their millions of website designer and developer visitors.</p><h4 id=\"takeaways--1\"><strong>Takeaways:</strong></h4><ul><li>Once you get traffic, whether it’s a lot or a little, survey your users to learn who they are, how they use your service or product, and to find what else they’d like or what other challenges they’d like to tackle</li><li>To get even more ideas to make money from an open source project, <a href=\"http://larszimmermann.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/OSHW-Business-Model-Matrix-Vs-0.6-_-Kopie-700x681.png\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> is a useful cheatsheet I like to use from Lars Zimmermann.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-3-getting-the-community-involved\">Step 3: Getting the community involved</h3><p>So once Font Awesome found a way to get people to use their service, and found users willing to pay them for it, what’s the point of being open source besides making it easy for people to use it?</p><p>In their case it wasn’t getting people to help them co-develop code or more icons, because they don’t allow for that. But being open helps them get the involvement of people who want to help.</p><p>Little by little they’ve built a community. And sometimes, there are people in this community that spontaneously contribute.</p><p>There is this story of an Italian guy called Jeremy who took it upon himself to answer lots of issues on GitHub that kept piling up daily and being helpful to the rest of the community.</p><p>So Font Awesome gets people to help take care of the community, open issues on what new icons they want, and validate new projects with them.</p><p>When you get substantial traffic (in their case millions of visits per month and hundreds of thousands of users), this kind of customer support can really help a small team focus on more strategic stuff.</p><h4 id=\"takeaways--2\"><strong>Takeaways:</strong></h4><ul><li>Allow people to do what they want. When they happen to be helpful, interact with them, encourage and recognize regularly those good things they do. You might even want to schedule a moment every day or week to scan what’s happening and recognize publicly what good deeds are happening in your community.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-4-build-the-tribe-before-you-need-it\">Step 4: Build the tribe before you need it</h3><p>People regularly mention Kickstarter as a validation tool for entrepreneurs. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. Your product should be validated way before you even consider creating a crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>To make it big in Kickstarter, there is a crazy amount of work that needs to be done before you launch, such as building your story, attracting a community, creating a video, building the right product and so on…</p><p>And that has nothing to do with Kickstarter.</p><p>Imagine this. You are preparing a birthday party, you take care of the decorations, the activities and so on a week before, and when the date arrives you realize that you forgot to make friends along the way who wanted to attend your party. So the party has started and you frantically stop people in the street or at the market and ask them if they’d like to attend your party… Which is over in four hours and has two people attending!</p><p>As Seth Godin <a href=\"https://www.thedominoproject.com/2012/06/why-kickstarter-campaigns-fail.html\" rel=\"noopener\">says</a>:</p><blockquote>“Build your tribe before you need it, give the tribe something that they want, and make it easy for them to believe it’s actually going to work. Kickstarter looks like a shortcut. It’s not. It’s a maximizer.”</blockquote><p>And that’s the kind of advice Font Awesome followed.</p><p>In 2014, once they had their tribe they launched a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232193852/font-awesome-black-tie?ref=profile_created\" rel=\"noopener\">first kickstarter campaign</a> with mainly homemade videos, copy and visuals. This first effort brought in $71,000 from 732 backers, which is pretty good, specially for an open source project.</p><p>But the truth?</p><p>Given the incredibly big and raving tribe of users their service had, they could have probably done way better.</p><p>I generally recommend to those starting their projects to be frugal on spending. I see many people in startup mode spending themselves to bankruptcy because there is this logo, video or website they have to have.</p><p>So the advice goes: “Don’t spend anything unless you have people paying you for your services and justifying this expenditure, or unless the investment can multiply itself and pay more than it costs.”</p><p>But once you’ve proven that you have users who love your product, like Gandy did, you should prudently go for it and stop pinching pennies and doing it all yourself:</p><blockquote>“Your video is the very first thing people see when visiting your project. But Kickstarter videos are tough to make. We should know. A couple of years ago, we launched the Kickstarter for Black Tie, a multi-weight icon set. We wrote, directed, shot, and edited it ourselves. And it shows. The video quality is off, the whole thing had to be overdubbed because we didn’t know how to do audio, the background music is just terrible, and I am absurdly awkward on camera. It was bad. In spite of that, the campaign did raise a bit over 200% our goal, which was great. But we learned we needed to work with folks who actually know how to make phenomenal videos”, <a href=\"https://blog.fontawesome.com/how-font-awesome-5-became-kickstarters-most-funded-software-project-4a63c035e84\" rel=\"noopener\">writes Dave Gandy</a>.</blockquote><p>So 2 years later, in 2016, they went on to organize a new Kickstarter campaign. This time they hired a professional team. To find the right video producers, they went to Videopixie, a platform where production companies can bid for your business, and looked for people who were more focused on telling their unique story than on the technique. They ended up going for Knox Avenue who delivered a video that explained the benefits of the service and that was hilarious enough to make people want to share it:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\" data-test-label=\"fitted\">\n        <div class=\"fluid-width-video-container\">\n          <div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\" class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\">\n            <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CNoH3J7iSrA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" name=\"fitvid0\"></iframe>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </figure><p>This time around, the video helped the campaign raise $1,076,940 from 35,550 backers, becoming the most funded and backed software and open source project on the platform so far.</p><p>So an investment of $15,000, which sounded like a lot to spend on a video, helped them raise $1,000,000 more than their previous campaign. That’s more than 66 times more!</p><p>So if you are not a professional communicator, get good professionals to help you with your media efforts. But ONLY once you’ve managed to gather a community that can justify you making this kind of investment.</p><p>If you want to dig into the nitty-gritty details of their Kickstarter campaign, <a href=\"https://blog.fontawesome.com/how-font-awesome-5-became-kickstarters-most-funded-software-project-4a63c035e84\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> is the article where Dave Gandy explains it all.</p><h4 id=\"takeaways--3\"><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</h4><ul><li>Find your first free and paying users before you ever consider creating a crowdfunding campaign, they’ll help you find what to offer</li><li>If you’ve done the previous step right and you have cash set aside, use it to pay a professional to help you to tell your story. There are just too many things to do during a campaign and, if done well, it will pay for itself</li><li>Once you’ve got a raving tribe that loves your product or service, use crowdfunding as a maximizer to launch your new products and get people to fund it before you create the next big thing</li></ul><h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3><p>Font Awesome has become one of the top two font services available with Google Fonts and has become the most successful Software project on Kickstarter. Here are the 5 takeaways you can tailor to your project based on their experience:</p><ol><li><strong>Find and put in practice your unique blend of skills.</strong> No need to be in the top 1% of talent. Be in the top 25% in two or more skills, mix them, and be unique</li><li><strong>Contribute to other people’s projects or platforms that have already developed their own audiences</strong>. Scratch an itch you may have to improve these projects, share it on open source, benefit from the exposure to their audiences and start building your tribe</li><li><strong>Once you’ve got your tribe, survey them to learn who they are, their needs, and find services or products valuable enough for them to get paid</strong>.</li><li><strong>Invite your community to help</strong>. Let them do whatever they want, support them with whatever tools they may need, and publicly recognize and promote their work</li></ol><p><strong>If you’ve done all of this, you’re ready to use a crowdfunding campaign as a maximizer </strong>(but not before)<strong>. </strong>Set cash aside to pay professionals videographers, copywriters and graphists who can help you tell your story better than you could.</p><p><em>Originally published at <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/font-awesome-kickstarter/\" rel=\"noopener\">boldandopen.com</a>.</em></p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

So they chose 10 pictures and put them up on a Tumblr blog for others to download for free — “10 free photos every 10 days”.</p><p>And from the moment Unsplash/Crew promoted their 10 pictures on a humble Tumblr blog on HackerNews, they’ve been getting millions of visitors and redirecting thousands of new customers to Crew’s marketplace, ultimately saving their business.</p><blockquote>[With Unsplash] We kept having this huge growth curve for the amount of effort that we were putting in, while on Crew, we had a full team and we were trying to get growth and it was a real battle. Eventually, we hit a million downloads within that first year, and that was our mark that this was really not slowing down - Mikael Cho, Founder of Crew and Unsplash</blockquote><p>That’s just an incredible return on investment for a few unused pictures that were going to gather dust in a hard drive.</p><p>That’s why today I’m going to show you some of the tactics Unsplash used to grow and sell Crew, their freelance marketplace, and grow their photography platform to 1 billion photos viewed per month with over 300,000 free high-resolution photos and 50,000+ contributors.</p><h3 id=\"1-take-your-unused-creations-to-untap-unreachable-distribution-channels\">1. Take your “unused” creations to untap unreachable distribution channels</h3><p>Unsplash had unused photos from a photo shoot for their website. And they had three choices. They could forget about them. They could try to sell them on a stock photo website. Or they could just give them away.</p><p>And giving them away has proven to be a far better idea than just keeping them for themselves or trying to sell them on a stock photo platform.</p><p>Recently, a team of researchers <a href=\"https://medium.com/who-what-why/how-side-projects-saved-our-startup-a83a80f3b3ae\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> that the most shared articles from the New York Times were ones that gave readers practical utility. Giving someone something useful tends to have the biggest impact on people. When you pair two powerful things like giving and photography, you reach a whole new level of impact.</p><p>To start doing this, you can use simple and free tools like WordPress.</p><p>Unsplash started on a $19 Tumblr blog to post its free photos. Once it really got traction and attracted customers and cash, it made sense to spend some time and money on building a proper platform to host Unsplash.</p><blockquote>We believed the good from giving our images away would far outweigh what we could earn if we required payment or credit. This proved true. By setting our images free, Unsplash turned into something much more meaningful than the hundreds of dollars we likely would have made selling them. Those first 10 photos photos have been seen 58 million times. Unsplash has become a community of over 20 million creators. People from all over the world have generously contributed over 250,000 photos, moving hundreds of millions of creative acts forward - Mikael Cho.</blockquote><p>Unsplash photos have not only helped designers and entrepreneurs create demos and websites, but have been a source of inspiration for everyone from teachers to nonprofits to independent creators.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*EXhgbBMwaghc9c9k\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*EXhgbBMwaghc9c9k\" width=\"800\" height=\"626\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>A few things <a href=\"https://madewith.unsplash.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">made with Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>If you are a designer or content creator — whether it’s code, recipes, agriculture, film editing, graphic design, photography, fashion, electronic hardware, material design, cars, planes, robots, or whatever — and it’s hard to get distribution for your work, there is a place for your open sourced ideas, especially if you share quality content and design.</p><p>Unsplash, Github, Instructables, Arduino, Adafruit, OS Vehicle (Now Open Motors), Local Motors, Wikihouse or Opendesk’s successes are a testament to that.</p><blockquote>When two-time #1 New York Times best-selling author Tim Ferriss was blocked from distributing his book in Barnes &amp; Noble, he uploaded excerpts from his book for free on BitTorrent to get distribution. Writer Leo Babauta “Uncopyrighted” everything on his popular blog, Zen Habits, in service of spreading his work further than he ever could alone. Chance the Rapper became the first artist to win a Grammy without selling physical copies of his album and giving most of his music away for free - Mikael Cho</blockquote><p>You share something for free and attract an audience and contributors, which in turns attracts an even bigger audience and inspires even more contributors to create and contribute.</p><p>70% of people who download images from Unsplash are people who have never downloaded anything from a stock photo site before. And the same applies to any other industry. 70% of people who will download new copyright-free content will be people who are currently not buying anything from that industry anyway, but who could in turn become creators, remixers, and promoters.</p><p>It’s fair to imagine that if you share your designs in open source and invite other to share as well, you could be untapping a whole new audience who would have never have had access to your kind of work and help you build and promote it.</p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>Make a list of all of the unused content you have created</li><li><strong>Share this content in open source on a WordPress, Dropbox or whatever free tool you can find</strong>. Make sure of three things. Firstly, the content you’re sharing should not be widely available elsewhere. Secondly, people should find the content really useful even though it’s free and be motivated to contribute to its creation. Thirdly, the content should be so useful that people would be ready to pay for it.</li><li><strong>Open and publish 1 to 10 ideas per month</strong>. For example, 1 to 10 photos or designs per month.</li><li>And <strong>offer people to subscribe to your newsletter</strong> to get more open ideas each month so that you can keep growing your audience.</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-find-an-audience-who-would-pay-for-your-open-source-project-and-give-it-away-freely\">2. Find an audience who would pay for your open source project, and give it away freely</h3><p>Don’t go to where your open source audience is. Instead, go to where people are already paying for the kind of open source content you are already sharing.</p><p>A mistake I see many people make, and that I also made myself in the beginning, is to share your work with other peers because they will understand what you’re making. Many developers join other developer events or LinkedIn Groups, instead of going to events or groups where nobody does what they do.</p><p>Beware, your peers know how to do what you do, so they might be interested in your open source content, but they won’t pay you for whatever other service you offer.</p><p>So you should look for people who will pay for your services. And if you are a non-profit, this would be people ready to push the donate button.</p><p>Nothing beats free. So whatever people have been paying for, they’ll be delighted to get it for free. Which should drive tons of traffic and attention to your open source project, but also to your paying products.</p><p>In Unsplash’s case, they didn’t go to photographers at first. They went to <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5794083\" rel=\"noopener\">Hacker News</a> to share their free photos, a website that gathers a community of entrepreneurs and computer science enthusiasts.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*Q4rNPVO-r1OvuYG0\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*Q4rNPVO-r1OvuYG0\" width=\"773\" height=\"113\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><blockquote>We put that up on Hackernews, and within a few hours, it went to number one. The site started crashing because we had public Dropbox links. The head of engineering at Dropbox happened to look at the Hackernews post and said that they’d upgrade us to the maximum pro plan for the day. They’re not supposed to be used for public Dropbox links, but he said they’d keep the site up because they think it’s cool. And that was day one of Unsplash - Mikael Cho</blockquote><p>Cho knew his audience was looking for free and beautiful photographs for their websites. And they are often hard to find even on Flickr, or even in stock photography websites. So Unsplash was a really good fit.</p><p>And on top of that, an audience of entrepreneurs could also be interested in hiring other developers, freelancers and designers on their Crew website, creating a virtuous circle for their business.</p><p>Here are some other examples of open source projects’ paying audience and peers:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*sBQI2APNlXDAABUp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*sBQI2APNlXDAABUp\" width=\"622\" height=\"755\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li><strong>Make a list of the kind of people who already pay for the content you’re offering in open source</strong></li><li><strong>Then list the websites or events where these people go to regularly</strong></li><li><strong>Promote your open source content in these websites and events.</strong> For example, Unsplash went to Hacker News, VentureBeat, Digital Trends, Lifehacker, and Tech Vibes, where it knew many developers are looking for free and beautiful photographs people couldn’t find on Flickr.</li></ul><h3 id=\"3-direct-traffic-to-your-service-or-product-page-with-your-open-source-project\">3. Direct traffic to your service or product page with your open source project</h3><p>Once Unsplash got people coming to their platform, they just had to add a link to Crew to attract new clients to hire freelancers from their marketplace.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*X4uhw1PXLz_Yy4qx\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*X4uhw1PXLz_Yy4qx\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@samuelzeller\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">https://unsplash.com/@samuelzeller</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>This simple link in Unsplash has attracted <a href=\"https://crew.co/blog/how-side-projects-saved-our-startup/\" rel=\"noopener\">over 5 million visitors to Crew</a>. From mobile and web designers and developers willing to offer their services on Crew, to paying customers interested in hiring their freelancers to get custom websites or apps made.</p><p>But Unsplash doesn’t only benefit Crew. Any photographer contributing images can add a link to his own business and benefit from Unsplash’s traffic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*tO_K53w35Iy2N3Ki\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*tO_K53w35Iy2N3Ki\" width=\"794\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@samuelzeller\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">https://unsplash.com/@samuelzeller</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>In Fact, by uploading 460 images, Samuel Zeller has gotten <a href=\"https://medium.com/unsplash/ive-been-sharing-my-photography-for-free-on-unsplash-for-the-past-4-years-here-s-what-i-found-7af80c8df39f\" rel=\"noopener\">over 255 million views and over 1.7 million downloads of his images.</a></p><p>That’s how his first client, the biggest banks in Switzerland, found him and gave him 4 projects when he started as a freelancer in 2016.</p><p>The reason why they reached out to him? They were already using a few of his Unsplash images in their global database and wanted more in the same style.</p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li><strong>Use your open source project to link to and promote a paying service</strong>. For example, Unsplash used to link to Crew’s Marketplace. Adafruits tutorials links to their e-commerce products, WordPress links to their affiliate hosting partners, and so on.</li><li><strong>Give contributors a place where they can promote their own profiles and services.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=\"4-create-a-win-win-relationship-with-your-creators-of-free-content\">4. Create a win-win relationship with your creators of free content</h3><p>Once you’ve found people willing to pay for your services and download your open source content, it’s time to invite your peers to contribute.</p><p>This will make your open content more valuable, and will also attract an audience your contributors want to reach.</p><p>At the beginning, photographers could post ten photos every ten days on Unsplash if they had been approved. And that’s really when Unsplash took off to another level.</p><p>Unsplash could compel photographers to give their pictures for free by showing them that giving content sitting in their hard-drives could help them create an audience for themselves.</p><p>Some other benefits they could get for contributing are:</p><ul><li>To direct unprecedented amounts of exposure that created a lot of <strong>site traffic</strong></li><li><strong>To get client referrals</strong></li><li><strong>To use it as social proof</strong> (a photographer can tell his clients that his pictures have had thousands of views and downloads on Unsplash)</li><li><strong>To practice their craft</strong></li><li>To use photos to <strong>build an audience</strong> they can direct toward making a living.</li><li><strong>Or trying to truly give back to the community</strong>.</li></ul><p>In fact, photographers have themselves <a href=\"https://community.unsplash.com/articles/why-i-share-my-photos-on-unsplash\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> getting client work booked after posting just a couple of photos. Others have been flown around the world on photoshoots. Some have gotten enough work to leave their jobs and become full-time photographers. Some have been able to build audiences for new products. And every contributor Unsplash spoke to has enjoyed the impact their photography has made toward moving creativity forward.</p><p>Today, a photo featured on Unsplash is seen more than a photo on any other platform. More than on Instagram. More than on the front page of the New York Times.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*1B_1HxUMRPa0guwe\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*1B_1HxUMRPa0guwe\" width=\"800\" height=\"894\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ugmonk/status/870260821678592001/photo/1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Photographers no longer need to come with an audience or have an agent to be great. Unsplash brings an audience to them.</p><p>As an independent designer myself, I understand you can’t do everything for exposure because exposure doesn’t pay the bills. But to completely dismiss the value of exposure doesn’t make sense either.</p><p>All artists need an audience to survive. Why do we spend time posting on Instagram if we don’t get paid for it? Because those posts build an audience over time.</p><p>In the last ten years, several platforms like YouTube, iPhone, Twitter, Instagram, SoundCloud, and Medium have enabled more and more of us to express and connect. Sometimes, this expression and connection is done for fun. For nothing but the purpose of creating. Other times it’s done to create an audience for something else. Filmmakers distribute trailers for free on YouTube to sell a movie. Musicians release free songs or entire albums on SoundCloud to sell concert tickets. Authors give free chapters and pour thousands of unpaid hours into blogs to sell a book.</p><blockquote>New open source platforms don’t kill industries. They change the distribution - <a href=\"https://medium.com/unsplash/the-future-of-photography-and-unsplash-811f114aab7a\" rel=\"noopener\">Mikael Cho</a></blockquote><p>Open Source platforms can open up an opportunity for so many people to share their craft with huge audiences instantly. New platforms create a distribution channel and community we otherwise wouldn’t have. In this sense, there’s never been a better time to be a creator.</p><p>Takeaway:</p><ul><li><strong>Make a list of places, websites and events where your peers are hanging out</strong></li><li><strong>List and explain to contributors the benefits they’ll be getting by contributing their own content</strong> (For example, getting site traffic to build their audience, get client referrals, social proof, a way to practice their craft or give back to the community)</li><li><strong>Provide a way for others to contribute their own content as well and curate their content</strong>. This could be a simple call to action to send you a contribution by email at the beginning, and after a while you could just create a form from which people can directly post their submissions.</li><li><strong>Curate their contributions</strong> to make sure quality is high</li><li><strong>Encourage your community of contributors to use your project to promote their own paying services or websites so they can also benefit from sharing their content in open source</strong>. The bigger the incentive to contribute, the more they’ll want to build open source content on top of your platform.</li></ul><h3 id=\"5-creating-other-revenue-streams-for-unsplash-s-future\">5. Creating other revenue streams for Unsplash’s Future</h3><p>Now that Crew has been sold to Dribbble, Unsplash became its own entity. Since it can’t rely on Crew to fund its operations anymore, it has to become financially sustainable.</p><p>So to find new ways to earn money with a 100% open source company, there are a few ways that Unsplash could be headed foward:</p><h4 id=\"native-advertising-\">Native advertising:</h4><p>There’s a lot of really interesting real estate that exists on Unsplash. For example, the way people are using Unsplash today is a lot like Google search except that it’s for images. The plan is to add a native advertising component to Unsplash.</p><p>Let’s say someone is searching for shoes and there are these really nice pictures of shoes already on the platform. Let’s say Nike shoes are also on the platform. That way you’d have a native advertising element that’s built into that search.</p><p>It’s would still be a high-quality thing. Instead of using crappy banner ads and showing a bunch of advertisements, targeted ads could be displayed. This would add value to Unsplash and would also be a way for Unsplash to make revenue.</p><p>Unsplash could also work with contributors to make some of the content, so the photographers who work with a brand and want to get involved with Unsplash could actually make connections.</p><blockquote>There’s a whole double benefit that happens. We believe that the best way we can make money is to help others make money - <a href=\"https://betakit.com/unsplash-co-founder-mikael-cho-says-companys-focus-is-in-mobile-native-advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Cho</a></blockquote><p>People searching for these images can in turn embed them in their websites, creating even more advertising for the brand.</p><p>Other Open Source projects like Read the Docs are funding their projects with what they call “<a href=\"https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html\" rel=\"noopener\">ethical advertising</a>”.</p><ul><li>They respect users while providing value to advertisers.</li><li>They don’t store personal information about users.</li><li>They only keep track of views and clicks.</li><li>They don’t build a profile of your personality to sell ads against.</li><li>They only show high quality ads from companies that are of interest to developers.</li><li>The products advertised should be interesting to the user.</li><li>The ads won’t flash or move.</li><li>They report that they run the ads they want to have on their site, in a way that makes them feel good.</li><li>And they also give 10% of their ad space to community projects, as a way of saying thanks to the open source community.</li></ul><blockquote>Update: Unsplash actually put in place their sponsored banners after this post was written. You can find them in the homepage and in the reminders to credit the photographers you get when you download an image.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*mjvhNR338uGWh55i\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*mjvhNR338uGWh55i\" width=\"800\" height=\"394\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Screenshot of Unsplash page with sponsored links to Squarespace</em></figcaption></figure><h4 id=\"ad-revenue-sharing-for-photo-contributors\">Ad Revenue Sharing for Photo Contributors</h4><p>Another way Unsplash could make money would be to insert these ethical or native ads and give the ability for contributors to opt into an ad revenue sharing option.</p><p>Scott Webb explores <a href=\"https://scottwebb.me/monetization-unsplash/\" rel=\"noopener\">this idea</a>:</p><blockquote>Could Unsplash work out some kind of algorithm to determine ad revenue for contributors based on their photo views and photo download? Maybe photo likes would be incorporated into the algorithm too.</blockquote><blockquote>Whatever the case may be, with highly targeted native advertising built into the site, could a revenue share happen with contributors? Could we see something like we see for content creators on YouTube, but with photos?</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t know how it could be technically worked out, but that Unsplash Team is smart or they’ll find the talent to make it happen.</blockquote><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>Find a simple business model to fund your open source operations.</li><li>If you don’t know how or where to start, <strong>to find out how to make money with Open Source, go <a href=\"http://bloglz.de/business-models-for-open-source-hardware-open-design/\" rel=\"noopener\">to this post</a></strong> from the great Lars Zimmermann.

row making open source hardware.</p><p>Today I’m going to show you exactly how Adafruit became one of the <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/profile/adafruit-industries\" rel=\"noopener\">fastest growing hardware manufacturers</a> in the US for 3 years in a row. You can copy this EXACT strategy to make money with open source hardware and create a community of contributors who will help you develop and promote your project faster than you ever dreamed of.</p><p>Limor Fried, Adafruit’s founder, is a force of nature among open hardware pioneers.</p><p>You might have already heard about her, but if you haven’t</p><ul><li>Adafruit was founded in 2005 by MIT hacker &amp; engineer, Limor “Ladyada” Fried.</li><li>Her goal with Adafruit was to create the best place online for learning electronics and making the best designed products for makers of all ages and skill levels.</li><li>She’s grown her manufacturing company by by <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/profile/adafruit-industries\" rel=\"noopener\">742%</a> between 2013 and 2015 to over $33 million.</li><li>Adafruit has grown to over 100+ employees in the heart of NYC with a 50,000+ sq ft. factory.</li><li>She’s rubbed shoulders with other figures of the maker movement like Massimo Banzi and David Cuartielles (Arduino’s founders), Mitch Altman, the creator of TV-B-Gone, among many more.</li><li>Her company’s website has over 1 million unique visitors per month, and its YouTube Channel has more than 250,000 subscribers.</li></ul><p><strong>So she’s clearly doing something right…</strong></p><p>The following sections will elaborate on how she did it.</p><h3 id=\"step-0-find-out-what-people-want-then-validate-it\">Step 0 - Find out What People Want… Then Validate it</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*RCyaTVByjeFs7aJv1hRDZw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"1*RCyaTVByjeFs7aJv1hRDZw\" width=\"400\" height=\"498\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Limor Fried demo-ing the Project Glass alpha-version in 1999<br> Photo Source: <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/photos.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">MIT Media</a></figcaption></figure><p>Before Limor Fried sold electronic kits, she was a student at MIT. While she was studying for a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, she learned how to draw her own schematics.</p><p>She went to school, like thousands of other students at MIT each year. But unlike most of the other students, she didn’t just take notes in class, or learn her lines and then continue with her life.</p><p>What made the difference for her was that she <strong>put into practice</strong> the skills she learned in class. She did it by building functional objects like MP3 players, synthesizers and light toys from scratch using custom-ordered parts.</p><p>And that’s how she became original. Through practice. By applying what she learned.</p><p>This was before YouTube and smartphones. So she posted DIY tutorials for her projects on her personal website. Soon, a crowd of viewers bombarded her via email with requests to sell pre-assembled kits.</p><p>At first she says that she was like, “No dude, I’m really busy, leave me alone”. But after a few months, her fans wore her down and “forced” her to open Adafruit to sell kits that people were asking for.</p><p>What Limor didn’t realize at the time is that she was validating a business idea for free. And this is the best way to start a business. Before you spend money and time on a business idea, that’s the kind of validation you want to get before you start anything.</p><p>So if you want to start a business, before you worry about selling anything, learn a skill that’s useful to you and to other people. But don’t just learn it. Practice it until you find your originality. And then share how you do it.</p><p>Even if you can’t get into the MIT, there are loads of free or cheap courses where you can learn really cool and valuable skills. There are hundreds of free or cheap courses in places like <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Coursera</a>, <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Code Camp</a>, <a href=\"http://udemy.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Udemy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Udacity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Instructables</a>, but also many amazing open source resources you can find in <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Github</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wevolver.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Wevolver</a> and pretty much all over the internet.</p><p>If you are learning or know how to design electronic boards, robots, computers, cars, drones, shoes, bamboo bikes, clothing, indoor aquaponic systems, 3D printers, make your own versions, with your own flavor. Then go organize a Meetup or post some YouTube videos to teach others around you how they can do it themselves.</p><p>Once you’ve found something to teach that other people rave about, you’ll be able to build pretty much any business around it. That could be a starter kit, a curation of products you used to build something, or custom consulting for people who want you to hand-hold them. Here are a few <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/find-profitable-ideas/\" rel=\"noopener\">more</a> <a href=\"http://openitagency.eu/business-models/\" rel=\"noopener\">ideas</a> of how to find valuable ideas.</p><p>Today there is more noise and competition than ever on YouTube and other social media, so it might be easier to invite some friends, coworkers or to start a Meetup or some offline event where you share your practice. Once you are confident enough, you can go online. There is still plenty of content taught by people who have never put them into practice.</p><p>Once you start teaching, whether online or offline, if people like your content or way of presenting, they’ll let you know what they want, and you’ll find what you need to offer. If they don’t, just listen to the problems they have and see how you can help them.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p><ul><li>Learn a new skill, practice your skill and get cool results for yourself or for other people</li><li>Teach other people how to get the results you got</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-1-starting-simple-with-the-3-fundamentals\">Step 1 - Starting Simple with the 3 fundamentals</h3><p>So to build her business, she just needed three super simple things:</p><ol><li><strong>A product</strong> - Kits for people who wanted to learn how to create their own electronics with her tutorials.</li><li><strong>A marketing channel</strong> - Free tutorials and the Open Source blueprints of her kits, so that anyone could study, modify, distribute, make and sell the design or hardware based on that design. This way she would teach people how to assemble electronics, how to improve their skills, and eventually, how to create a business on top of her idea. A pretty compelling idea for everybody.</li><li><strong>A selling channel </strong>- A simple e-commerce website where people could order her kits.</li></ol><p>That’s how simple an open source hardware business should be at the beginning. So if you are going to create an open source project, don’t over-complicate it and stick to these basics.</p><p>For example, if you sell kits, you can probably start creating them manually at your closest FabLab, or assemble some custom parts you can order on the Internet.</p><p>With YouTube and WordPress you have everything you need to start your own tutorial channel.</p><p>And with PrestaShop, WooCommerce or any other E-commerce website, you can start a free or low-cost selling site very quickly.</p><p>But be warned, there is a condition if you want your open project to really work. There must be no previous tutorials on how to do what you want to share. As Limor Fried puts it in her own words,</p><blockquote>I think the company took off because, before these kits, there wasn’t a learning project out there that you would actually use or wanted to keep - Limor Fried</blockquote><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>:</p><ul><li>Make sure your idea or skill has not been widely taught elsewhere. Teach your skills online or offline. This will help you find one product or idea that people crave. Create free tutorials and open source your blueprints to market your idea.</li><li>Set up a way of selling it, like a simple E-commerce website.</li></ul><p>For Adafruit, people were craving her pre-assembled electronic kits. She marketed them by creating and sharing unique web-tutorials on how to put kits together that she sold through her website.</p><h3 id=\"step-2-open-source-your-technology-to-create-a-community-of-co-creators-and-save-time\">Step 2 - Open Source your technology to create a community of co-creators and … save time</h3><p>To get the community to innovate with Adafruit, Limor Fried open sourced its designs and allowed everybody to build on top of it by giving access to it <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit\" rel=\"noopener\">on GitHub</a>.</p><p>Adafruit also created <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">online tutorials</a> for each and every one of their kits. The link for the instructions is on every product page. <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/hacking-the-kinect?view=all\" rel=\"noopener\">Here’s</a> an example of a tutorial they created to reverse engineer a Kinnect with their parts.</p><p>Having the documentation online allows Adafruit to update the instructions easily and get people to work with their products quickly and easily.</p><p>It sure looks like a lot of work to document each step of the process. But once you’ve done the whole documentation for a product, it will become a resource thousands of users can reuse without you having to explain it over and over again, saving you hundreds of hours and multiplying your effort by a thousand fold.</p><p>“Everything is designed to be painless,” Fried says. “I spend a lot of time thinking about how customers will interact with products so they won’t break them. And when we sell something, we always give good documentation to get (them) going in a couple minutes.”</p><p>And this is not only useful for electronic products. Other open source hardware companies, like <a href=\"https://github.com/aquapioneers\" rel=\"noopener\">Aquapioneers</a>, who sell aquaponic kits, <a href=\"http://www.afforestt.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Afforestt</a>, who grow urban forests 10 times faster, or <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Connected-Greenhouse-for-Easy-and-Productive-Gar/\" rel=\"noopener\">Myfood</a>, who sell connected greenhouses, have also documented their processes for their community, helping attract a lot of initial interest, and <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/shubhendu_sharma_an_engineers_vision_for_tiny_forests_everywhere\" rel=\"noopener\">millions of views</a> from communities of users, <a href=\"http://aquapioneers.io/#the_news\" rel=\"noopener\">media</a> and <a href=\"http://www.poc21.cc/myfood/\" rel=\"noopener\">partners</a>.</p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>:</p><ul><li>Open Source your designs and tutorials, so you build a community of people who can freely build on top of your products and create new use cases and innovations.</li><li>Always stay on top of copycats by updating your products by including your community’s innovations and feedback.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-3-how-to-find-funding-shipping-and-ramp-up-operations\">Step 3 - How To Find Funding, Shipping, and Ramp Up Operations</h3><p>With $10,000 Fried’s parents had allocated for her tuition, she bought a bulk quantity of parts and began assembling and selling her kits, making about $10 on each unit.</p><p>Once she found a way to fund her first orders, the running of the company consisted of shipping a couple of packages a day from the 24-hour post office next door to her dorm.</p><p>As orders increased, she hired friends, and before she knew it, she was designing a new project every week around newfangled components like gyrometric sensors, solar panels and thermal printers.</p><p>If you don’t have a family that can afford to help you fund your first batch of orders, you should take extra care at step 1 and 2 above to gather a tight community that wants to support you. This way you’ll be able to crowdfund your first batches of products.</p><p>And when you can’t keep up with the pace of demand, ask your friends to help. And also ask your open source network if they know great people you can hire to help you increase this pace.</p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>:</p><ul><li>Hardware is expensive to start, so <strong>secure funding for your first orders</strong>, either through your family and friends, either through crowdfunding with your community. Make a profit on each kit or product you sell to fund the next batches.</li><li>When demand becomes too big for you to handle, <strong>find friends to help you scale your operations.</strong></li><li><strong>Keep updating your products</strong> by including the innovations and feedback of your community.</li></ul><p>In Adafruit’s case, Limor Fried got $10,000 in funding to buy parts and turn them into kits from her family. And as orders grew she hired friends.</p><h3 id=\"step-4-the-open-source-circle-of-awesome-fostering-innovation-talent-and-sharing-among-the-community\">Step 4 - The open source circle of awesome: Fostering innovation, talent and sharing among the community</h3><p>To encourage people to stick around and really be proud of their projects, the company fostered a community, both online and offline.</p><p>Adafruit scaled the open source tutorials and the customer support, by inviting every user to post their DIY projects on their hardware platform, filling their website with third party tutorials.</p><p>Indeed, everyone is invited to the DIY party, from elementary-school students building robotic arms to grandmothers sewing jackets with working LED movie displays using Flora, a wearable electronics platform with conductive threads and washable hardware.</p><p>The web is full of third-party tutorials for Adafruit’s open-source projects, but Adafruit also has three full-time engineers dedicated to troubleshooting.</p><p>Involving the community in the creation of content and innovation create an awesome virtuous circle.</p><p>Imagine you start with 1000 people following you through Facebook, YouTube or your Newsletter, and a 100 people buy products from you.</p><p>Well, among these 1000 people, you might be getting 10 people who submit new tutorials and product ideas of their own, like prosthetics, children’s toys, TV controllers, 3D printers and whatnot. And this in turn attracts and enables more people to create new ideas, and on and on.</p><p>That’s when the fun really begins. <strong>The open-source designs lend themselves to a culture of sharing,</strong> and tens of thousands of Adafruit customers are feeding off each other’s creativity, tinkering with more powerful MintyBoosts and iNecklaces that flash at different speeds and cycle through bright colors.</p><p>People learn and come back with fixes, send us weird Halloween costumes based off our kits, Fried says.</p><blockquote>I read blog posts and tweets from customers, and I definitely get ideas from them that I personally might not have thought of - Limor Fried</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*cmsguGxqIXaWoGQS.\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*cmsguGxqIXaWoGQS\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Adafruit’s community in action, building cosplay costume with their electronics and 3D printed parts</em><br> <a href=\"https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/04/13/genos-cosplay-with-adafruit-neopixels-wearablewednesday/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em>Photo Source</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Little by little the power of this virtuous circle is what helped attract millions of people every month to Adafruit’s website and what led it to grow over 700% over 3 years in a row and get 1 million unique visitors per month to their website.</p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>:</p><ul><li>Create open channels for your community to interact with you, listen to what they are saying and creating, and promote their own innovations on your blog. This will create additional content to create buzz around yourself, and it gives back to your community by showcasing their work on a platform that they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.</li></ul><p>More on other open channels you can create have been listed below.</p><h3 id=\"step-5-an-old-school-forum-to-do-support-10-times-easier\">Step 5 - An old school forum to do support 10 times easier</h3><p>The forum is only for Adafruit customers who need assistance with their purchases. But even if it’s not for “everybody”, it’s an open and transparent door for the customers to interact with the the company, and search for solutions that might already have been answered.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*mpjD0iHKzI0xV4LY.\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*mpjD0iHKzI0xV4LY\" width=\"800\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Adafruit customer support forum- A.k.a How a jurassic tool (in digital terms) can do a lot of heavy lifting</em></figcaption></figure><p>People ask their questions, and once they are answered in public, it’s far easier to redirect to that thread than to serve each individual request for support.</p><p>In fact, sometimes the community of users will spontaneously help other users, helping the staff cover more ground.</p><p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> Don’t open a forum if you are completely swamped with production. Depending on the number of customers you have, answering and moderating questions can take a quarter to half of your working time.</p><p>But again, investing a little time here would go a long way, and you should consider customer support just as important as selling or marketing.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p><ul><li>Open a forum and reply to support questions if you or someone in your staff can devote 1 to 2 hours a day to customer support.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-6-keep-validating-your-new-product-ideas-with-the-community\">Step 6 - Keep validating your new product ideas with the community</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*RXsM4J6dpczs8xyW.\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*RXsM4J6dpczs8xyW\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Photo Source: Adafruit Industries</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Show &amp; Tell</strong> is Adafruit’s live show where makers from all around the world come in and share the electronic projects that they are currently working on.</p><p>The show runs on Hangouts for 30 minutes every week and is the place where they invite 8 to 10 makers from their community to showcase the projects they’ve been working on.</p><p>Instead of doing typical market research to learn what their customers want, <strong>Show &amp; Tell</strong> is a great way for Adafruit to get insight into not only how people use its products but also what they might want in new ones.</p><p>Over the four years that it has been running, Show &amp; Tell has been produced more than 200 times, collecting more than 2.8 million minutes watched and an astounding half a million video views.</p><p>To find some examples of the Show &amp; Tell broadcasts you can <a href=\"https://blog.adafruit.com/category/show-and-tell/\" rel=\"noopener\">go here</a>.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p><ul><li>Host and broadcast a weekly Hangout with up to 10 people where makers showcase their own creations and get feedback from the rest of the community, it will give you great input on new innovations you can take over, and potentially discover makers with whom you could create new partnerships.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-7-promote-by-teaching-with-0-tools\">Step 7 - Promote by teaching with $0 tools</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*weJmJFCkyvuDNnKs.\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*weJmJFCkyvuDNnKs\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Limor Fried started the <strong>Ask an Engineer</strong> weekly show in 2010 in her living room. And since that day she’s gotten over a half million video views to add to the ones of Show and Tell.</p><p>To get these results, she uses free tools like YouTube and Periscope to broadcast interesting or useful behind the scenes content every week about:</p><ul><li>The week’s product that appeared in the shop</li><li>Time Travel - the hosts look back on the world of makers, hackers, artists and engineers and highlight a special person or event</li><li>3D Printing - they showcase a special project or product related to the industry</li><li>A Q&amp;A session and a trivia question, where the first viewer with the correct answer wins a product</li><li>A section dedicated to Raspberry Pi and Arduino news and a section where the hosts read a positive email that they have received from a satisfied customer.</li><li>Every week, a coupon code for a 10% rebate on everything in the store is issued and is valid only for the night.</li></ul><p>To find some examples of their broadcasts you can go to their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPxoAKJ5WUs&amp;list=PL7AE4BFB81D3DC925\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube playlist</a>.</p><p>Adafruit also produces the YouTube series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXWHQhEVEI5Jqf18TQRr5Hu\" rel=\"noopener\">Circuit Playground</a>, meant for children. Each episode covers an electrical engineering concept. For example, one episode is titled “F is for Frequency”. Fried says she wants electronics to be “just as enjoyable for kids as watching their favorite movies”.</p><p>So as you can see, this is not super complex, it’s just a matter of being regular and making a list of interesting content that you can share with your audience. And if you fear you’ll run out of topics to talk about, your community is full of interesting people that you can invite to talk about cool things they’re doing.</p><p>As you’ve probably realized by now, Adafruit’s main way of growing is by teaching. So teach, teach, teach!</p><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>:</p><ul><li>Make a list of things useful and interesting to your community, like the latest news of your products, or personalities in your industry, or a section about complementary products to your product. Plan a regular moment each week to broadcast this content. If you feel good in front of the camera, you can launch a live YouTube channel where you talk with your community about all of this content. If you are camera-shy, do a live podcast, write a blog post, or whatever you can think of to get the word out.</li><li>Consider rewarding your viewers with a coupon at the end of the broadcast.</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-8-find-talented-employees-among-the-maker-community\">Step 8 - Find talented employees among the maker community</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*bZY-n_o1bY7J-QQm.\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"0*bZY-n_o1bY7J-QQm\" width=\"269\" height=\"188\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Adafruit Employees</em><br> <em>Photo Source: Adafruit Industries</em></figcaption></figure><p>Once you’ve reached hyper growth as Adafruit has, it becomes essential to hire people with high potential who can help lead the company to keep up with this pace.</p><p>Adafruit doesn’t do unpaid internships, <a href=\"https://blog.adafruit.com/2012/03/18/internships-at-adafruit-why-we-do-not-have-un-paid-internships/\" rel=\"noopener\">only paid ones</a>, but as they report themselves “most of our recent hires at Adafruit have been because the maker was sharing what they do online.

But don’t just learn it. Apply your learnings and practice it until you find your originality.</li><li>Step 1 - <strong>Teach for free</strong>. Teach what you practiced for free online or offline. When you find something that people crave, then you can sell kits or consulting through your website or offline.</li><li>Step 2 - <strong>Open Source your designs and tutorials</strong>. This way you’ll find a community that can freely build on top of your products and create new use cases and innovations.</li><li>Step 3 - <strong>Find funding</strong>. Either ask friends or family to help fund your first batches, or, if you’ve gathered an audience large enough, crowdfund your first orders with your community.</li><li>Step 4 - <strong>Create open channels to interact with the community</strong>. Listen to what your community of makers are saying and creating, and promote back their inventions. This will create additional content to create buzz around yourself, and it gives back to your community by giving them a platform than they wouldn’t have otherwise.</li><li>Step 5 - <strong>Use a forum to provide customer support</strong>. Devote 1 to 2 hours a day to reply to support questions on the forum.</li><li>Step 6 - <strong>Discover and showcase the communities innovations</strong>. Host and broadcast a weekly Hangout with up to 10 people where makers can showcase their own creations and get feedback from the rest of the community.</li><li>Step 7 - <strong>Create content useful to your community</strong>. You can launch a live YouTube channel where you talk with your community about a number of things useful and interesting to your community, like the latest news of your products, or personalities in your industry, or a section about complementary products to your product.</li><li>Step 8 - <strong>Hire your community of makers</strong>. Whenever you need to hire someone, you can find the most talented prospects among those who contribute on your platform.</li><li>Step 9 - <strong>Launch a challenge to invite makers to create open source alternatives to big player products</strong>. Sponsor and launch a “Challenge Prize” to get the community to develop an open source alternative to a product you’d love to see open. This will offer great PR, and show other companies of the benefits of open source. And don’t skip steps. Launch a Challenge Prize only once you’re making cash!</li></ul><p>Much information was shared through <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225213\" rel=\"noopener\">this</a> article.</p><p>Originally published at <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/adafruit-case-study/\" rel=\"noopener\">boldandopen.com</a> on March 1, 2018.</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

traditional business is a great struggle. Finding clients, polishing your product, making payroll, finding the right employees, automating processes…Since there are so many moving parts, you’re always wondering — Where do I focus now? Am I doing the right things? What should I be doing next?</p><p>And if you are trying to build a social or an open-source business or a cooperative, there are even more moving parts.</p><h3 id=\"building-a-business\"><strong>Building a business</strong></h3><p>A traditional entrepreneur has to make money to get and maintain employees. But a social, 0pen or cooperative entrepreneur has added constraints. They must also create a social impact on their community, or deliver a positive ecological impact on the environment.</p><p>Most advice revolves around how you can make money with open source. You can sell support, build an open core and sell the extension, or sell a subscription to a cloud-hosted version. But once you know how you’re going to make money, nobody tells you where you should focus your efforts at each stage of your venture.</p><p>Should I be working on my community of contributors? Should I be looking for clients? Should I hire someone to help develop the product?</p><p>I’ve been working with traditional and collaborative business owners for the last 4 years. I’ve kept asking myself if there’s a way to know I’m heading towards the right path.</p><p>There are challenges to running a business — especially an innovative and pioneering collaborative business. You feel like your situation is different than that of all other businesses around you. This often leads you into a trap. You think that the solution lies in developing something complex. But this leads to the death of projects through loss of time and money.</p><h3 id=\"you-re-not-alone\"><strong>You’re Not Alone</strong></h3><p>The reality is that<strong> your situation is not different.</strong> Every business, yours included, depends on a very few business models. And every open community also depends on a few community models.</p><p>Entrepreneurs must accept that their business is not so unique. It unshackles the handcuffs of misery and doubt and brings the joy of liberation. They will see a simpler road ahead. If they start applying the right strategies, they’ll reach the next level without dealing with the hardships others face.</p><p>For example, say you’re just starting up and you’ve found a way to sell your product to your customers. You are starting to make payroll, but you’re still not profitable. There is no sense in hiring a customer service manager, a CFO, or in creating operation systems to make your company more efficient. At this stage you need to improve your product and get more clients.</p><p>When you’re in the startup stage of a business (and at any stage later on), there are some core areas to focus on. This focus allows you to graduate to the next level and prevents you from sliding back into previous stages.</p><p>So let’s see what these stages are and what you should be focusing on at each stage.</p><h3 id=\"stage-1-the-validation-stage\">Stage 1: The Validation Stage</h3><p>At this stage you have no business yet, just an idea. And you’re most likely filled with self-doubt, worry, and the fear of failing. Maybe you’re still at your job and have to develop your idea after work hours. Or you’ve just quit and you feel a sword of Damocles hanging over your head.</p><p>For most of us, the biggest hurdle is the fear of rejection when asking for money for something you created. If you need inspiration, go watch <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection\" rel=\"noopener\">this video</a> about someone who was rejected for 100 days. Then come back here.</p><h4 id=\"conquering-your-doubts-and-moving-forward\"><strong>Conquering your doubts and moving forward</strong></h4><p>Once you’ve gotten over the doubt and rejection, find a product or idea that people really need and want. When you think you have it, go validate your idea with the target group you want to serve. Go talk to people in person or by phone to find out how you can best make them happy.</p><p>Next, create the proper documentation, install instructions, and make demos of how to use it. Get a proper license that will allow people to reuse and co-develop the project with you.</p><p>Once you get someone to download or buy your open-source software or hardware, ask them some questions. Why did they download it? Why did they buy it? What problem are they trying to solve? This will give you incredible insights that will help you further develop your idea.</p><p>Until you have a product compelling enough that people will download or buy, you have no community and no business.</p><p>And the product alone will not sell itself. Once you have that, you’ll also have to find a marketing and sales system that attracts clients to your product or service.</p><p>At this stage you’ll need to put a <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/how-to-validate-business/\" rel=\"noopener\">validation system</a> in place to understand the real needs, frustrations, and priorities of the market. Otherwise, when you launch your product, you’ll have a very slim chance of success. You’ll also waste a lot of time, money and energy.</p><p>So, make sure that:</p><ul><li>You have validated that your product or service works well</li><li>People have confirmed they’re interested in using and buying it</li><li>You have one or more distribution channel that works</li><li>You have people interested in contributing and developing on top of your idea</li></ul><p>Then you can confidently say that you are in business.</p><h4 id=\"what-you-should-focus-on-in-the-validation-stage-\"><strong>What you should focus on in the Validation stage:</strong></h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/find-profitable-ideas/\" rel=\"noopener\">Developing</a> and <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/how-to-validate-business/\" rel=\"noopener\">validating</a> your product or service</li><li>Developing your <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/how-to-sell-an-open-source-project-ethically/\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing and sales system</a></li><li>Starting your community of co-developers</li><li>Finding your first distribution channel</li></ul><h3 id=\"stage-2-the-startup-stage\">Stage 2: The Startup Stage</h3><p>At this stage you are starting to get sales coming in. You’ve found a community of users, contributors and customers, and you feel the excitement of being in business.</p><p>Getting out of the Validation Stage sets you apart from many people who never manage to do so.</p><p>Now, you still have a very long and steep mountain to climb ahead of you. Your company is probably still not profitable. Your sales are inconsistent, and you’re doing most tasks yourself because you can’t pay anyone to help. You waste a lot of time doing things, and your doubts starts creeping in. Am I done for? How will I ever get ahead of the infinite To-Do list I have ahead?</p><p>It feels quite lonely. And it is one of the hardest places to be.</p><p>But most entrepreneurs at this stage are completely ignorant about how hard it will be. Otherwise you’d give up. But this ignorance is a blessing. It will keep you optimistic, and most of all persistent, which is the only way to get out of this stage.</p><h4 id=\"getting-out-of-the-startup-stage\"><strong>Getting out of the Startup stage</strong></h4><p>To get out of the Startup stage, you should focus on solidifying your Open Source Community and your sales, marketing and product. If you focus on anything else you’ll be wasting energy and it will take you longer to get to the next stage.</p><p>If you’re not marketing savvy, learn and put systems in place to get your product or service in front of others. You want to get them sharing, talking, and most importantly, buying.</p><p>Here are <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/how-to-sell-an-open-source-project-ethically/\" rel=\"noopener\">some examples</a> you can use.</p><p><a href=\"http://ivanakimov.com/1m-downloads-of-an-open-source-project/\" rel=\"noopener\">Hashids</a>, created by Ivan Akimov, is a phenomenal open source project that could have marketed itself. But Ivan knew better. A product, however good it may be, is never good enough to market itself. So he created a <a href=\"http://ivanakimov.com/1m-downloads-of-an-open-source-project/\" rel=\"noopener\">thoughtful plan to promote</a> his idea.</p><p>He emailed some famous technology newsletters. He submitted the project to forums where it might interest people. He answered relevant questions on popular forums and wrote blog posts. And this got him 1 million downloads over 5 years. Pretty good…</p><p>So at this stage, focus on inviting and attracting people who would love your project. Check your to-do-list. If most tasks are not geared towards marketing your idea, you should redirect your attention. And if you don’t know how, <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/how-to-sell-an-open-source-project-ethically/\" rel=\"noopener\">learn</a>. Otherwise, it’s going to take you forever to leave this stage. You might be tempted to give up.</p><p>For example: You need $5000 a month and your product sells at $500? Then you need to create a system that consistently brings 10 buyers every month (10 x $500 = $5000). You won’t be out of this startup stage until you can reach your minimum number of sales.</p><h4 id=\"what-you-should-focus-on-at-the-startup-stage-\"><strong>What you should focus on at the Startup stage:</strong></h4><ul><li>Keep developing your product.</li><li>Solidify your marketing and sales system.</li><li>Keep nurturing your community of co-developers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"stage-3-optimization-stage\">Stage 3: Optimization Stage</h3><p>You’re past the startup level. You’ve have managed to have enough revenue and profit to be more relaxed. You get enough prospects and clients to support the kind of life you are looking for. Now you can focus on the project you’ve been longing to bring to life for so long.</p><p>But you are constantly laboring. Most of your time is spent thinking about your business and your community. And this leads you to feel stressed and overwhelmed.</p><p>Most entrepreneurs reach this level through their persistence and hard work. But most of the time, it is also their glass ceiling.</p><p>Not because what they created isn’t appealing enough to their customers and community. But because they have focused on developing their product, marketing and sales skills. They don’t know how to put operational systems in place.</p><p>And that can make you overwhelmed. You see that you are working very hard, but can’t see how you can extract yourself from your business. You can’t see how you can trust or delegate to others. If you take yourself out of the equation, the business wouldn’t be profitable. This might be leading you to the edge of burnout.*</p><p>*There might be a service business at this stage that brings a phenomenal style of life. Still, setting some operational systems in place can bring in really powerful wins.</p><h4 id=\"getting-your-systems-operational\"><strong>Getting your systems operational</strong></h4><p>So at this point you need to be spending more time on the operations of your business. Focus on administration, financial systems, internal communications systems, quality control, fulfillment, customer service, administration, billing, software and logistics.</p><p>These are all the areas that slow you down and can suck the life out of you.</p><p>You are the king or the queen of bootstrapping and think you can do it yourself. But now that you have enough revenue, consider hiring some people. A project manager, consultant or operations manager can help you put these things in place. They’ll develop technology that will smooth the process out. This will become the support structure of the business.</p><h4 id=\"what-should-you-focus-on-at-the-optimization-stage-\"><strong>What should you focus on at the Optimization stage:</strong></h4><ul><li>Build a support system to help you deal more efficiently with the operations side of things.</li><li>Keep nurturing your Community of co-developers and creating systems to simplify their interactions. Focus on forums, improved documentation, easing the installation of your open source code or design, and so on.</li></ul><h3 id=\"stage-4-scale-up-stage\">Stage 4: Scale Up Stage</h3><p>Once you get past the Optimization Stage, you’re free from most daily activities that were keeping you on the hamster wheel of entrepreneurship. You have a LOT of free time.</p><p>At this stage, profits decrease because you’ve likely invested a lot in systematizing your operations. But sales and revenues are likely to increase. Your team has a lot more bandwidth to work on <strong>developing new distribution channels</strong> and finding new markets for your products and services.</p><p>Sometimes, the founder stops trusting everyone to do their jobs. They begin micro-managing all the systems and processes that the team has put together. This is likely to frustrate everybody, and will drive your team or open source community out of the company or project.</p><h4 id=\"avoiding-pitfalls-and-investing-in-people\"><strong>Avoiding pitfalls and investing in people</strong></h4><p>Make sure you attract more talented people to your business or project and invest in their leadership skills. Invest also in the culture of the company to drive the business forward. Give up the operations to a COO and instead focus on the strategic vision of the project. And start a new project.</p><p>Most entrepreneurs are more comfortable starting rather than running things. So take a look at what suits you, decide if you are better at “starting” or “running” a business, and stick with it.</p><p>For example, Red Hat reached this stage by developing their company on top of Linux. They used their Linux foundational playbook to <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/about/blog/what-makes-us-red-hat\" rel=\"noopener\">develop different spin offs</a>. There is the Red Hat of containers, the Red Hat of OpenStack, the Red Hat of middleware, virtualization, storage and a whole lot more.</p><h4 id=\"what-should-you-focus-on-at-the-scale-up-stage-\"><strong>What should you focus on at the Scale Up stage:</strong></h4><ul><li>Develop new distribution channels and find new markets for your products and services.</li><li>Invest your time and resources to attract qualified talent.</li><li>Develop the leadership skills of your team and community of open source co-developers to build a great team and culture.</li></ul><h3 id=\"stage-5-leader-up-stage\">Stage 5: Leader up Stage</h3><p>So you have finally made it. Your company is profitable, automated, and has great people working to move it forward. At this point your company has reached the peak of the entrepreneurial mountain.</p><p>Everyone wants to partner with you, and you’ve got a great deal of negotiating power. This makes it easier to get favorable terms and deals done, and publicity and press is easy to get. You’re at the point in the cycle where “the rich get richer.”</p><h4 id=\"enjoying-the-success-and-avoiding-the-flop\"><strong>Enjoying the success and avoiding the flop</strong></h4><p>If you were a traditional company, you’d be on your way to becoming Google, Facebook, or Airbnb big. If you were an Open Source project this would mean you’d be on your way to becoming Linux, Sparkfun or Wordpress big. And if you were a cooperative you’d be in the same league as Mondragon, John Lewis Partnership, or Organic Valley.</p><p>When you manage to reach this stage, it means that you have coped with tremendous challenges. You’ve overcome market slides, new disruptive innovations, and other kinds of sharks that wanted to take your business down.</p><p>And even if you’ve managed to get over these pitfalls, you are now risking a very new set of challenges: leadership failure and other human vices like greed, power, and vanity. This has happened to a few traditional and open-source companies. They collapsed in face of faster innovators or under the weight of their own vices. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Kodak</strong> became obsolete because its leadership failed to see that the digital camera boom would take over and bankrupt their company.</li><li><strong>Enron’s and Worldcom’s </strong>fraudulent accounting made them the largest bankruptcies in the world at the time.</li><li><strong>Apple </strong>failed from 1986 to 1996 without Steve Jobs because leadership allowed their products to become too complex and cluttered. Once Steve Jobs came back and simplified the products to only 4 computers, everything started taking off again.</li><li><strong>Taxis </strong>are becoming obsolete because of more convenient on-demand apps like Uber.</li><li><strong>Uber’s</strong> power and vanity is starting to create scandals of <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/technology/uber-scandals-timeline-2017/2/\" rel=\"noopener\">sexual harassment, technology theft</a> or <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/dark-genius-how-programmers-at-uber-volkswagen-and-zenefits-helped-their-employers-break-the-law-b7a7939c6591\" rel=\"noopener\">illegal practices to avoid local law</a>. This is likely driving quality leaders from the company and eroding the perception of the company among its drivers, employees, and users.</li><li><strong>Makerbot</strong> has seen its latest innovations fail when it decided to close all its open-source designs. This made its whole open source community feel betrayed and abandoned. It ultimately lead Maketbot to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/27/why-makerbot-and-3d-systems-are-losing-the-desktop-3d-market/\" rel=\"noopener\">lose their market share to more hacker friendly products and forced them to fire 120 employees</a>.</li></ul><p>To counter the risk of slow decay, traditional companies can launch new innovative products, buy complementary companies, or buy competitors.</p><p>Steve Jobs made a responsible leadership move by launching the iPhone. It effectively killed and replaced the market for the iPod (Apple’s most profitable product at the time). The iPhone eventually became their new flagship product.</p><p>When Google bought Applied Semantics it allowed them to build the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdSense\" rel=\"noopener\">biggest and most profitable ad network in the world</a> on top of the biggest search engine in the world. Then they bought Android to create the most used mobile OS to compete with the iPhone.</p><p>Facebook bought Whatsapp to avoid having another big messaging competitor. They bought Oculus Rift to pave their way for the upcoming wave of Virtual Reality.</p><p>Red Hat also <a href=\"https://investors.redhat.com/ir-resources/investor-faqs/what-acquisitions-has-red-hat-made\" rel=\"noopener\">acquires other companies</a> to bring in new offerings for their clients.</p><p>Acquiring promising startups or launching new products become the moves that keep vulnerable but cash-positive companies afloat.</p><h4 id=\"some-benefits-of-open-source-projects\"><strong>Some benefits of Open Source projects</strong></h4><p>In the Open Source and cooperative worlds there is a less competitive landscape. One company doesn’t acquire the other. Instead, two complementary companies can become part of the same cooperative or foundation. Then they can develop new win-win partnerships to reinforce all their networks. This way they can build economies of scale while strengthening their distribution power. They also enlarge their pool of clients and enrich their suite of products and services.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-sell-your-widget-on-sparkfun?_ga=2.161589692.1489046097.1496049852-1947656909.1496049852\" rel=\"noopener\">Sparkfun</a> allows other Open Source projects to manufacture and sell their designs. In exchange, they get royalties on every product sold. The smaller and more innovative open source companies get access to high quality manufacturing, as well as the large audience and distribution channels Sparkfun has built over the years.</p><p>Sparkfun gets to offer more valuable products that it couldn’t offer otherwise. But it also gets to avoid competing with all of these smaller companies by partnering with them, which is another great advantage.</p><p><strong>What should you focus on at the Leader Up Stage:</strong></p><ul><li>Keep all the business’ key areas optimized (product, sales, marketing, distribution channels, operation systems, technology, finances, team and leadership…).</li><li>Acquire or partner with complementary or competing companies to keep developing new distribution channels, new products and services and attracting qualified talent and leadership.</li><li>Innovate<strong> </strong>by developing new products.</li><li>Invest in developing the leaders of your company<strong> </strong>to keep moving the business forward.</li></ul><h3 id=\"in-short\">In Short</h3><p>Let’s summarize the 5 stages your business will go through:</p><ul><li>At the <strong>Validation Stage,</strong> you have to validate your product or service idea. Find your first clients and open source contributors.</li><li>At the <strong>Startup Stage,</strong> you have to improve your product and solidify your marketing, sales, and open source community.</li><li>At the <strong>Optimization Stage</strong>, you have to create systems to deal with your administrative, logistical, and financial operations.</li><li>At the <strong>Scale Up Stage</strong>, you have to focus on bringing in talented people and building a great company culture.</li><li>At the <strong>Leader Up Stage</strong>, you have to work on innovating, building new partnerships, and acquiring other companies.</li></ul><p>Use this tool to liberate yourself. Figure out if you are walking on the right path or you are stuck somewhere. Don’t look for perfection. Instead, use this framework to find out where to focus your energy while growing a business.</p><p>The path is the same whether you want to remain a small business or spread your innovations all over the world. It’s the same for every single business.</p><p><strong>Inspiration:</strong></p><p>Todd Herman’s <a href=\"http://toddherman.me/the-five-stages-of-business-growth/\" rel=\"noopener\">Five Stages of Growth</a></p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

Not to mention all the companies who patent their creations.</p><p>If this is your case, you might be preventing commercial re-use in hopes that no one else will profit from your creation. This way you might be able to profit further down the line.</p><p>You want to reserve the right to commercialize your work. You want to get others to ask for permission to license your creation first.</p><p>But this non-commercial license is putting off potential partners by being too restrictive and lowering the adoption of your project.</p><p>Because if others can’t freely copy your work, they won’t be able to make money with your idea. And if they can’t make money with it, they won’t be able to repay you. Logic right?</p><p>From 2003 to 2014, the percentage of fully free / open licenses has gone from 20% to <a href=\"https://stateof.creativecommons.org/report/\" rel=\"noopener\">56%</a> of all Internet licenses.</p><p>So yes, the world is becoming more open and people are getting less and less wary of how their work is re-used.</p><p>This might be evidence enough to show people see commercial benefits in giving complete open access to re-use and re-sell their creations.</p><p>But let’s find out the exact reasons openness could be good for your business.</p><p>When you allow for commercial reuse of your creation — whether it’s software, hardware, education or any artistic endeavor — it is more likely that you’ll get others to build an ecosystem around your creation.</p><p>If people can’t sell what they create on top of your creation, they are less likely to use it altogether. This prevents others from enhancing your project and creating a larger ecosystem of innovations around it.</p><p>You may not be the only one benefiting from your creation, but that’s actually good since you’ll also be benefiting from everyone else’s creations.</p><p>And if you get hit by a bus (god forbid), your work can still live on without you.</p><p>So let’s see some examples of the surprising benefits free licenses have over non-free licenses.</p><h3 id=\"getting-repaid-and-employed-by-your-users\">Getting Repaid and Employed by Your Users</h3><p>An extreme example of this is MySQL. They developed an open source database solution that had over 15 million users of their product and 15 thousand paying customers. So 1 paying customer for every 1,000 users.</p><p>It might not seem like much, but it worked for them. They had enough cash to pay for their expenses.</p><p>They had huge non-paying users like Craigslist or Facebook. Craigslist wanted to pay them, <a href=\"https://opensource.com/business/14/9/open-source-business-models-part-2\" rel=\"noopener\">but they didn’t know how</a>, so they sent them $10,000.</p><p>Facebook was another big non-paying user until the day they were growing so fast that they had too much to do. So ultimately they asked MySQL to maintain their databases and bought a support contract to keep Facebook going.</p><p>Facebook later became one of their biggest customers. In software, most projects will use an open source project to save money. But big projects with more important things to do, will pay you to get it done.</p><p>The lesson here, is that allowing others to make commercial use of your creation will allow others to reach heights they wouldn’t have imagined possible without your help.</p><p>Once there are bigger companies that use your solution, you can look for those that make money with it. Offer them your help and they’ll probably be happy to pay to unburden themselves on you, the inventor and expert of the open source software or hardware that they are using.</p><h3 id=\"get-distribution-well-beyond-your-means\">Get distribution well beyond your means</h3><p>For Nina Paley, filmmaker and cartoonist, sharing her work through an open license has helped her get over the hell of making a self-produced animated movie to making money.</p><p>At first, her movie “Sita Sings the Blues” was losing money at every turn because of copyrights. Its release was delayed by the prohibitive cost of licensing 80-year-old songs from little-known singer Annette Hanshaw.</p><p>“When my film was still illegal and hemorrhaging money to legal and licensing costs, I joked that if the film were free, I could sell T-shirts,” Paley said.</p><p>This was the kindle to look up how people made a living giving away free software.</p><p>“I realized that merchandise and voluntary support is actually where the money comes from,” Paley recalls.</p><p>So she went on to share her film under a Creative Commons BY-SA license for anyone to download for free. It was picked up by Roger Ebert and other critics and went on to be viewed millions of times all over the world. So she made it available to purchase on DVD and also sold merchandise around her movie characters.</p><p>From that point on she claims that “I’ve never had more money coming at me than when I started using Creative Commons BY-SA. I have a higher profile. I don’t spend anything on promotion. My fans are doing it for me and buying merchandise. Sharing put me on the map.”</p><p>If your work is good, people will be naturally inclined to share it, even commercially.</p><p>Making it easy for others to redistribute your work will bring more people to your shop than you could have ever on your own.</p><p>To make sure people find it you should get it under the nose of influencer interested in the kind of work you do. This could be movie critics if you are into movies, or technology reviewers if you are into technology for example.</p><h3 id=\"an-army-of-crazy-remixers-who-make-your-invention-more-valuable\">An army of crazy remixers who make your invention more valuable</h3><p>When Massimo Banzi and David Cuartielles launched Arduino in 2005, they decided to publish their hardware designs under a Creative Commons BY-SA license. This meant anyone could copy their design and sell it without giving money back if they didn’t want to.</p><p>And this is exactly what made Arduino the most popular micro-controller for DIY hardware geeks.</p><p>This allowed people to build things with Arduino from scratch. They were not competing with Arduino, but creating further uses of their idea.</p><p>Thanks to Arduino, people started building the first open source 3D printers (a.k.a RepRap and Makerbot), commercial drone companies, dirt cheap prosthetics, kits to learn programming but also synthesizers, guitar amplifiers, voice-over IP phone routers and many more things.</p><p>Allowing people to reuse their work, made it possible for users to stop reinventing the wheel and to create their commercial or hobbyist projects. And this is what has allowed Arduino to redefine the de-facto standard for micro-controllers, strengthening their sales too.</p><p>This has also been true for other open source powerhouses like Linux, WordPress and many other open source languages and hardware projects.</p><p>Linux has seen an ecosystem of commercial companies <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/linux-is-25-yay-lets-celebrate-with-25-rad-facts-about-linux-c8d8ac30076d#.y1cpvg6mn\" rel=\"noopener\">grow around it</a>:</p><ul><li>SpaceX uses a special design of Linux in each of its rocket engines. Through this, Linux has helped complete 32 space missions.</li><li>GoPro uses it to run its cameras</li><li>97% of the world’s supercomputers run on Linux — including clusters used by NASA</li><li>Red Hat makes over $5 billion in revenue by selling the services they’ve build on top of Linux</li><li><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-linux-in-your-car-movement-gains-momentum/\" rel=\"noopener\">Cars</a> use linux to power their software</li><li>The tiny $5 Raspberry Pi computer is also powered by Linux</li><li>About 1,000 drone companies develop drone services that run on top of this operating system</li></ul><p>So you could say that Linux also empowered others to create over <a href=\"http://www.enterprisetech.com/2015/09/30/linux-study-claims-5b-in-economic-impact/\" rel=\"noopener\">$5 billion in market value in 2015</a> across different industries. This makes every company using it interested in the success of the open source project, and that’s why they support the foundation responsible of maintaining it with millions of dollars every year.</p><p>WordPress also has an ecosystem of commercial companies and freelancers that has spawned around them:</p><ul><li>Plugin developers</li><li>Theme developers</li><li>Hosting providers</li><li>Agencies, freelancers and consultants specialized in building WordPress sites</li><li>E-commerce and publishing platforms of all kinds</li></ul><p>Automattic, the company responsible for WordPress, makes over $50 million in revenue, and it has enabled WordPress users to create a <a href=\"https://freemius.com/blog/540-million-active-plugins-makes-wordpress-a-billion-dollar-market/\" rel=\"noopener\">$1 billion market</a>.</p><p>Because Arduino’s circuit designs are licensed with CC BY-SA, so too are these derivative projects. The same goes for WordPress and Linux’s GPL license.</p><p>Everyone is free to do as they please with the designs and the code, but they have to release the work built on top of these platforms under the same license, creating a chain reaction of crowd creation.</p><p>Because all of these projects are open source and allow commercial reuse of their inventions, their teams don’t have to provide support. The community is more inclined to help and is of course more forgiving of a lower customer support.</p><p>“By putting the Creative Commons stamp on circuit designs and board layouts, we were able to turn hardware design into a piece of culture that people can build upon,” Banzi says. “Whatever happens to us, the project will always survive.”</p><h3 id=\"enabling-innovation-in-places-you-wouldn-t-otherwise-reach\">Enabling Innovation in Places you wouldn’t Otherwise Reach</h3><p>I said before that if people can’t sell what you created, they are less likely to use it altogether. But this might be something you actually want.</p><p>You might have created an algebra educational video under a Non-Commercial license because you don’t want “Big Bad Corporations” to rip it and take advantage of your freely available work.</p><p>But since the license applies the same to everyone, you are also preventing small Ethiopian education startups from using it. And you might want them to be able to use it.</p><p>What’s more important to you? Stopping big corporations from ripping off your work or helping more people innovate with it?</p><p>Clarifying your goals and values might help you find out.</p><p>If you want to get a chance to make a profitable open business there are three conditions you need to fulfill:</p><ul><li>Make something remarkable</li><li>Create an open space for the community to learn how to use and remix your work</li><li>Think of <a href=\"http://boldandopen.com/find-profitable-ideas/\" rel=\"noopener\">ways you can make money with it</a>, and deliver a quality product and service</li></ul><p>And if you were worried others would take your invention without giving back, remember that gratitude can manifest in ways much more powerful than money alone.</p><p>Giving away your inventions will attract more opportunities, users and contributors than you could imagine by building a company the old school way.</p><p>If you liked this post, and would like to get more articles on how open source can help your business or project you can <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/crltyv\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>sign up here</strong></a>.
