GPA. Before we talk about this, let’s remind ourselves of the main purpose of a résumé.</p><p>The main purpose of a résumé is to highlight your knowledge, skills, and accomplishments succinctly. You want to include things on your résumé that you are proud of, but also things that will impress. You want to paint a picture of yourself in the best light possible so that recruiters and hiring managers want to interview you.</p><p>Now back to your GPA. It should be fairly obvious whether or not your GPA is impressive. If your GPA is below a 3.0, don’t put it on your résumé. There’s nothing wrong with excluding your GPA from your résumé if it only harms your chances.</p><p>If you have a GPA between 3.0–3.2, this is a judgment call. From personal experience, I have talked to some companies that require a minimum GPA of 3.2, but these were primarily financial or quantitative companies. Most software companies have little regard for your GPA. If you have anything above a 3.2, I would place it on your résumé.</p><p>If you have a low GPA, fear not, as this gives you the opportunity to be creative! My overall GPA was a 3.2 due to poor grades from my freshman engineering prerequisites and humanities classes. But once I finished and started taking courses within my major, my in-major GPA (GPA calculated from courses in my major) was a 3.44, which was significantly higher. So that’s what I put down (but make sure to qualify it as a departmental GPA).</p><p>There are many ways of going about presenting yourself in the best light possible, even when it may seem like the odds are stacked against you. I only provided one example of accomplishing this, but there are many more ways waiting to be discovered by you. Fully embrace your failures and accomplishments because they make up who are you. Be honest and truthful, and always focus on highlighting the best parts about yourself.</p><p><strong>Recap:</strong> Your GPA does not define you. The purpose of your résumé is to present yourself in the best light. Never forget that! Be creative when going about this and DON’T LIE.</p><h4 id=\"employment-4-\">Employment (4)</h4><p><em>Target Audience: Students with software engineering work experience</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/10_0_work_highlight_software_resume_tk.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"10_0_work_highlight_software_resume_tk\" width=\"1287\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Résumé: Employment Section</figcaption></figure><p>If you are a college student without any experience, don’t be afraid! This was my senior year résumé when I was applying for a full-time job. I was fortunate enough to have accumulated relevant work experience from summer internships, but this isn’t absolutely necessary to get an interview. If you find that you don’t have much to put in section, jump down to the ‘<a href=\"https://medium.com/p/b11c91ef699d#ed02\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Projects</a>’ section.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/10_1_work_highlight_software_resume_tk.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"10_1_work_highlight_software_resume_tk\" width=\"1287\" height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Résumé: Employment Section: Header Subsection</figcaption></figure><p>While it is great to have past work experience, not all work experience is treated equally when it comes to looking for a job in software engineering. Focus only on including work experience that has <em>relevance</em> to the job that you are applying for. For instance, if you have experience working as a cashier in retail or a waiter in the food industry, don’t include it! Unfortunately, your abilities to handle money or serve food did not provide any indication that you will succeed as a software engineer.</p><p>A recruiter’s goal is to match candidates with jobs that fit the candidates’ skill sets. Therefore it is essential only to include past work experience that has some relation to the position that you are currently applying to, on your résumé.</p><p>Part of accomplishing this means creating a collection of various résumés, each tailored specifically for the different job that you are interested in. This is analogous to the college application process, where you had to write separate essays for each university that you applied to. Each college has its own values, culture, and vision, making it nearly impossible to write a generic, one-size-fits-all college essay. Therefore, tailor your résumé to the job that you are applying for.</p><p>Lastly, a note on dates. Order your experiences in descending order starting with your most recent experiences. For undergraduates, this means being mindful of including experiences that are both recent and relevant. Sadly, no one cares about whatever accomplishments you had in middle school or high school. If the experience is outdated, leave it out.</p><p><strong>Recap:</strong> Have various versions of your résumé tailored for each job you are applying for. There is no one-size-fits-all résumé.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/10_2_work_highlight_software_resume_tk.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"10_2_work_highlight_software_resume_tk\" width=\"1286\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Résumé: Employment Section: Description Subsection</figcaption></figure><p>The hardest part about résumé writing is having descriptions that fully encapsulate your accomplishments from past work experiences in a meaningful and impressive way.</p><p>What does it mean for your descriptions to be meaningful and impressive?

This is someone we would like to interview and potentially hire.”</p><p><strong>The primary objective of the Employment section is to show the impact and value that you had while working at an established institution.</strong> Your goal is to show recruiters that you are a candidate that can get things done and do them well.</p><p>To best showcase my accomplishments in my résumé, I adopted the following powerful formula, created by the Former SVP of People Operations at Google, Laszlo Bock:</p><blockquote>“Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]” — Laszlo Bock</blockquote><p>You can see this very clearly in the very first bullet point of this section on my résumé.</p><p><strong>Improved device’s battery lifespan by 8% by integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state</strong></p><p>Let’s break it down:</p><p><strong>Accomplished [X]- </strong>Improved device’s battery lifespan</p><p><strong>Measured by [Y]-</strong> by 8%</p><p><strong>By Doing [Z]- </strong>integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state</p><p>I leveraged this formula in some shape or form in almost every sentence in my résumé.</p><p>To help you along this process, below is a word bank of excellent verbs you can and should use:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/08UNCYv26D5hz87HF-XkHIzD-G1PBj6X0PsE\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"08UNCYv26D5hz87HF-XkHIzD-G1PBj6X0PsE\" width=\"800\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Verb Wordbank</figcaption></figure><p>Here are some examples of fill-in the blank sentences that I have come up with for you to get started:</p><ul><li>Reduced _____ by _____ by _____.</li><li>Redesigned _____ for _____.</li><li>Implemented _____ for _____ by _____.</li><li>Improved _____ by _____ through _____.</li><li>Utilized _____ to _____ for _____.</li><li>Increased _____ by _____ through _____.</li><li>Integrated _____ by _____ for _____.</li><li>Incorporated _____ for _____ by _____.</li></ul><p><strong>Recap: </strong>Use the “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]” formula.

The utility behind this last bit is it enables the reader to really get a sense of the technology I am familiar with by explicitly stating the technologies that I used for the project.</p><p>This also allows me to have a concise, but clean ‘Skills’ section located at the bottom of my résumé. Recruiters can then look at the bottom to immediately obtain a sense of my capabilities by seeing which computer languages I am familiar with. If they are looking to see if I have specific knowledge in a particular tool, framework, or library, then they can find this out by looking at my projects.</p><p><strong>Recap: </strong>Including technologies that you used in your descriptions will help you bypass online keyword filters when applying online.

It shows that you are dedicated to expanding your knowledge of computer science and that you are not afraid of putting in the extra work to do so. Ultimately, it is a fantastic way to demonstrate self-initiative and genuine interest in this field.</p><p>The other benefit of doing personal projects is that you inevitably gain the skills that apply to work in the real world. Things that you don’t usually do at school, but you will do at work such as using standard frameworks/libraries, understanding full-stack web development, creating mobile applications, setting up a development environment, or programming efficiently with Vim.</p><blockquote><strong>Tip:</strong> Create a personal website that showcases and documents all of your personal projects. This is a little hack that ‘virtually extends’ your résumé beyond the one-page limit.</blockquote><p>To reiterate one last time, personal projects show your passion and dedication towards developing the necessary skills needed for a job that you don’t yet have. This is a <strong>must-have</strong> on any software engineering resume.</p><blockquote>“Build some iPhone apps, web apps, whatever! Honestly it doesn’t matter that much what you’re building as long as you’re building something. You can build a fairly meaty project in one weekend. This means that with about 3–4 weekends of work, you can make your résumé go from so-so to fantastic. Seriously — I’ve seen lots of people do this.”<br><br>- Gayle McDowell, former Google Engineer and Author of Cracking the Coding Interview</blockquote><p>If there is a specific company that you <strong>really</strong> want to work at, one of the best ways to stand out is doing a personal project that is directly related to the job that you are applying for.</p><p>I got my internship at Autodesk by taking a free online interactive computer graphics course on Udacity. The course taught me to use a JavaScript library called <em>three.js</em>, and it just so happened that there was a software engineering internship opening at Autodesk looking for someone with full-stack website and knowledge in <em>three.js</em> (aka ME).</p><p>A word of caution on this technique. This strategy is not perfect. This only really works for companies like Autodesk which do not have generalized software engineering internships like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. When starting off early in your career, it is better to generalize and figure out the different disciplines of computer science. Nonetheless, this is an excellent method worth trying if there is a specific company you want.</p><p><strong>Recap: </strong>Personal projects are imperative. If you haven’t already, start NOW! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p><h4 id=\"skills-6-\">Skills (6)</h4><p><em>Target Audience: Anyone looking for a software engineering job</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/03/12_skills_highlight_software_resume_tk.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"12_skills_highlight_software_resume_tk\" width=\"1287\" height=\"108\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Résumé: Skill Section</figcaption></figure><p>The title explains it all.

Since you are probably not practicing every language you’ve ever encountered on a day to day basis, including a proficiency level can help the recruiter know your strongest languages at a moment in time and other languages that you are familiar with.</p><p>I’ve opted to use two tiers:</p><ol><li><strong>Proficient </strong>- Languages that I am very familiar with, feel very comfortable using, and can interview with right now.</li><li><strong>Familiar</strong> - Languages that I have utilized in the past but may not be as knowledgeable in currently, but can pick back up given time.</li></ol><p>Other valid options include:</p><ol><li>Advanced</li><li>Intermediate</li><li>Basic</li></ol><p>or</p><ol><li>Expert</li><li>Advanced</li><li>Intermediate</li></ol><p>or</p><ol><li>Fluent</li><li>Proficient</li><li>Familiar</li></ol><p>or</p><ol><li>Working Knowledge</li><li>Basic Knowledge</li></ol><p><strong>Recap:</strong> When applying for a specific job online, cross-reference the job description and add essential technical keywords on your résumé to increase your chance of getting an interview.</p><h3 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Make sure your name and contact information is correct and legible</li><li>Be sure to include your education. If your GPA is low, leave it out or be creative!</li><li>Utilize the “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]” formula to effectively show the impact that you had in your past employment</li><li>Do personal projects — especially if you do not have past experience working in tech</li></ul><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>While this résumé got me interviews at numerous software engineering companies, there is no guarantee that following all the principles and techniques I have explained here will yield the same results for you.</p><p>This was my senior year résumé in 2017. It is a showcase of my journey and interest in software engineering. Copying it will do you no good, as technology is constantly evolving and the talent search is an ever-changing process. Instead, use this as a reference.</p><p>Use my résumé and this article as a resource to become a better résumé writer and a more effective communicator. Focus on learning how to best convey your skills and achievements to others. This in itself is an invaluable, lifelong skill that you will need wherever you go.</p><p>As you write your résumé, please remember — be yourself!</p><p>Your résumé is a list of <strong>your</strong> own accomplishments, achievements, and interests. Your goal is to craft the most polished version of yourself. Lastly, have fun and enjoy the process!</p><p>For anyone interested in using this resume template, I obtained it from<a href=\"https://careercup.com/resume\" rel=\"noopener\"> CareerCup</a> which was founded by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, author of <em>Cracking The Coding Interview</em>.</p><p>From personal experience, what’s <strong>most important</strong> is the content.
