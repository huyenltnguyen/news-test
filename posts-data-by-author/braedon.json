you need to consume an API that is also serving requests via HTTPS. </p><p>In this article, we will be setting up HTTPS in development for our create-react-app with our own SSL certificate. </p><p>This guide is for macOS users and requires that you have <code><a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">brew</a></code> installed. </p><h2 id=\"adding-https\">Adding HTTPS</h2><p>In your <code>package.json</code>, update the <strong>start</strong> script to include https: </p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"HTTPS=true react-scripts start\",\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts test\",\n    \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\n  },</code></pre><p>Running <code>yarn start</code> after this step will show you this screen in your browser:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/privacy-error.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"privacy-error\" width=\"1844\" height=\"1188\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>At this stage, you're already set to go with <code>https</code>. But you don't have a valid certificate, so your connection is assumed to be insecure. </p><h2 id=\"creating-a-ssl-certificate\">Creating a SSL Certificate</h2><p>The easiest way to obtain a certificate is via <code><a href=\"https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert\">mkcert</a></code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Install mkcert tool\nbrew install mkcert\n\n# Install nss (only needed if you use Firefox)\nbrew install nss\n\n# Setup mkcert on your machine (creates a CA)\nmkcert -install</code></pre><p>After running the above commands, you'll have created a <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority\">certificate authority</a> </strong>on your machine which enables you to generate certificates for all of your future projects. </p><p>From the root of your <code>create-react-app</code> project, you should now run:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Create .cert directory if it doesn't exist\nmkdir -p .cert\n\n# Generate the certificate (ran from the root of this project)\nmkcert -key-file ./.cert/key.pem -cert-file ./.cert/cert.pem \"localhost\"</code></pre><p>We'll be storing our generated certificates in the <code>.cert</code> directory. These should not be committed to version control, so you should update your <code>.gitignore</code> to include the <code>.cert</code> directory. </p><p>Next, we need to update the <code>start</code> script again to include our newly created certificate:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"HTTPS=true SSL_CRT_FILE=./.cert/cert.pem SSL_KEY_FILE=./.cert/key.pem react-scripts start\",\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts test\",\n    \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\n  },</code></pre><p>When you run <code>yarn start</code> again, you should now see that your connection is secure. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/07/secure.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"secure\" width=\"814\" height=\"436\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Don't be a stranger!

time I went over to Joey's house. His room was an absolute disaster as any 11 year old's room is. I made his parent's laugh after they apologized for the mess, \"it's no problem,\" I said, \"it's easier to see all of the stuff he has!\"</p><p>It wasn't until after high school that we completely deviated from one another. &nbsp;I went off to business school, while he pursued photography, having been rejected by all post-secondary institutions he applied to. </p><p>I would have never guessed that six years later we would be on the exact same path, – both <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-went-from-sales-to-frontend-developer-in-16-months/\">self-taught developers</a>, but on different tracks.</p><p>I remember when Joey first told me about the games he was building in Unity. We spent countless hours playing Minecraft when we were younger, so I assumed it was something in that realm. </p><p>I was soon going on a study abroad and certainly wasn't paying much attention to his new hobby. It never occurred to me this would blossom into anything greater.</p><p>He's gone from sharing his projects on Instagram, to co-founding a company in Finland, and completely starting from scratch on his newest venture, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/9centgames/\">9 Cent Games</a>.</p><p>I want to share his story here.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-you-start-teaching-yourself-game-development\">Why did you start teaching yourself game development?</h2><p>I had been dabbling in Photoshop and After Effects for about a year prior. I messed up my ankle up skateboarding and had a lot of free time. My work with Photoshop led me into 3D artwork. </p><p>I started thinking, what can I do with these 3D models? I can't make animations. It's too much work. I think you need a team for that. So I was like, maybe I can code these models.</p><p>I started trying to learn with these Unity tutorials. I actually gave up a few times before it really clicked in my head. Slowly, I started accumulating knowledge, just releasing simple games, asking questions on Reddit. The community on Instagram was also very, very motivating. And then it just turned into what it is now, six years later or something. I think I started in 2014.</p><p>Unity has a whole bunch of tutorials on YouTube. There was a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX0hnOS1QQQ&amp;list=PLX2vGYjWbI0RibPF7vixmr4x8ONJX-mNd\">space shooter</a> and then a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_fAidYRGzs\">roller ball thing</a>. I made a little ball game called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk4sO4m4uGI\">Tiles</a> based on their rollerball tutorial. That was the first game that I made.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-you-quit\">Why did you quit?</h2><p>Oh, I honestly just didn't understand it. I had a hard time really grasping even the most basic concepts of programming. For loops, if-statements, that kind of stuff. I was using the update loop in Unity to write like a hundred if-statements as opposed to just using one for loop to do basic stuff. I had no understanding at all.</p><p>Something kept dragging me back. I made a platformer, then a little shooter and then I built a game called Aldo, which was an action RPG that had six quests and a few different worlds. I kept trying to expand my games and the thought of reaching just a little further was exciting.</p><p>And then you realize you have huge gaps in your knowledge and you don't know how to plan these projects. So you kind of have to step back. Go smaller.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/96751992_233851337888133_8515543434855972864_n.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"96751992_233851337888133_8515543434855972864_n\" width=\"1958\" height=\"624\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Thumbnails of the early games</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-did-you-get-better-at-planning-projects\">How did you get better at planning projects?</h2><p>Honestly, studying games, looking at YouTube videos of game design breakdowns, and seeing how these games are built and the ideas behind them.</p><p>I would pick any element that I could find, replicate it and then try to make it my own in some little way. Or just straight-up, copy something and just see if I can programmatically replicate a cool mechanic.</p><p>It was all literally like hacking it together. I could show you some of the code that I wrote from way back and you would laugh.</p><h2 id=\"you-shared-everything-you-did-on-instagram-why-what-was-that-like\">You shared everything you did on Instagram. Why? What was that like?</h2><p>Instagram was and is the number one thing for me. That's kind of how it all started as well. There is a big development community there. Specifically a game development community. Everyone shares their artwork, comments on ideas; people are generally pretty supportive.</p><p>It was very motivating. Posting kept me active and pushed me forward because it's so solo. You can feel lonely at times. You have to really be self-motivated, get up in the morning on your own for no other reason than your passion for coding. </p><p>Instagram is sort of a way to stay accountable and a way to build motivation because the reach that you get, as well as the community, are real.</p><p>I still use the same hashtags today to stay in touch with the community like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/gamedev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#gamedev</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/indiegamedev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#indiegamedev</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/madewithunity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#madewithunity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/unity3d/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#unity3d</a>.</p><h2 id=\"instagram-actually-lead-to-you-co-founding-a-company-right\">Instagram actually lead to you co-founding a company, right?</h2><p>Yeah, I met my future business partner on Instagram. I was posting my artwork and he started with liking some photos. My partner really liked some of the weapon designs that I was doing. He eventually DM'ed me and we started exchanging ideas.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-10-at-19.49.03.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot-2020-05-10-at-19.49.03\" width=\"1870\" height=\"892\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>We traded ideas for a long time before I eventually bought a plane ticket from Toronto to properly meet him in Finland. It was a bit surreal. There's a massive community in Helsinki. Studios like <a href=\"https://www.rovio.com/\">Rovio</a> and <a href=\"https://supercell.com/en/\">Supercell</a> are based there. Finland is home to some crazy game companies.</p><p>I was starting to run before I could even walk. Soon we had our company, <a href=\"https://www.actionreaction.games/\">Action Reaction Games</a>, and had begun planning our first game, Battle Blobs.</p><p>We just started developing the game. I had never built a multiplayer game before, so that was a bit of a hurdle. We tried all these different back end tools, all kind of worked, but kind of didn't. Every day had a new challenge. I learned about 80 percent of everything that I know now during this time.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-you-find-other-like-minded-people-to-start-working-on-the-project-with-you\">How did you find other like-minded people to start working on the project with you?</h2><p>My partner led a lot of that because he was the networking guy. I was more on the technical side of it all in those days. He led the force on that. As I said, the community in Helsinki is huge!</p><p>I think he had two engineers that he was working with to build a prototype before I joined. The fit wasn't right, so they ended up leaving. Eventually, we found an artist to work with. And then another really, really technical guy from there. All of these people he knew from his network.</p><h2 id=\"at-what-point-did-it-become-more-serious\">At what point did it become more serious?</h2><p>Around April 2018. We were just closing the funding round and that's when things really started gearing up. It was incredibly strenuous leading up to that point.</p><p>It's a lot of meetings. It's a lot of pitches. It's a lot of meeting people for no reason that barely even respond to you, even though they seem very excited in the initial meetings. I wasn't there for many of them, but I was there for enough of them. I was there for the key ones that actually landed the investment rounds. So that was cool.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/office.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"office\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Our co-working space</figcaption></figure><p>It is a complete grind. It's a grind of just hardcore networking and just figuring out who's really going to give you money, who actually believes in you and why am I here?</p><p>Finland's just such a hub. Money moves kind of slow there, but in a sense, it also kind of doesn't. There are tons of angel investors and venture capitalists in Helsinki focused exclusively on game investment. I don't want to name drop or anything, but we had some really cool people involved in Battle Blobs on the financial side early on.</p><p>We ended up raising about 100k euros and then the Finnish government had a program where they essentially doubled that.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-things-change-after-the-investment\">How did things change after the investment?</h2><p>Scheduling everything, tight deadlines, and way more meetings. We had very specific goals and needed to move much faster. The pace was much different. It was definitely an ego boost.</p><p>There was more testing, playing, trying to get the team to coordinate better, which was a big struggle. We weren't always on the same page. It's tough. You knew in your heart that someone was really backing you. You kind of felt a huge sense of responsibility on that.</p><p>I was the only one that was remote, unfortunately. Everyone else was in the office every day working on it. I would come to Finland as much as I could and be there working hands-on, but I was the only one that was remote.</p><p>It's a little bit intimidating, especially when things start to get a little bit uncertain. You know, as things evolve and develop.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-biggest-success-of-battle-blobs\">What was the biggest success of Battle Blobs?</h2><p>Definitely the technology we built, the software and literally just getting the game to launch. We did a really successful launch. We had fifty thousand downloads. We had no monetization mechanics, unfortunately. That was a huge oversight by us.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/launch-party.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"launch-party\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Battle Blobs launch party</figcaption></figure><p>A lot of it was pretty organic. We did pay a company to help us with our marketing. I don't think they really helped too much. But then somehow China got a hold of it and it spiked.</p><p>It was really weird. It spiked around 15000 downloads over the course of two weeks, just randomly. We were not marketing in China at all. We were only marketing in the UK at the time. We were advised that was the best place. I question that now, but it seems that the marketing and the way our app looked right had some appeal there.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-you-start-to-feel-like-things-weren-t-going-in-the-right-direction\">When did you start to feel like things weren't going in the right direction?</h2><p>We were planning for a second investment round post-launch. Our main goal was to generate retention, generate engagement and basically just generate a high-quality product. We pushed hard to get that second funding round. We did everything we could, even pivoting the entire game into something more simple.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/prototype.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"prototype\" width=\"2220\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>An early prototype of gameplay</figcaption></figure><p>When that timeline starts to run down and you notice the cash flow is going down and the next thing you know, we're dropping off salaries because we want to survive a little bit longer. That's when things get pretty sketchy and you get to get a bit concerned about the whole thing of it and then you start to really question yourself.</p><p>I found I was questioning my entire viability as a co-founder. Even if we landed the funding round, could I even run this thing the way it needed to be run? I had virtually no experience running a company. It was a lot of self-doubt and strong emotions.</p><p>Being remote sucked when it was starting to crumble. It was hard to even work. I was sitting at my computer doing nothing because I had nothing to do. There was nothing to do. And we're just kind of waiting, hoping we're gonna land a funding round.</p><p>In mid-August [2019], my partner basically said, look, maybe do some damage control and find a job. If you need or do whatever you need to do. That was pretty much it.</p><p>I took a couple of weeks just totally off. I played Minecraft for two straight weeks; it was like therapy.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-to-the-company-and-everything-that-was-built\">What happened to the company and everything that was built?</h2><p>It still exists. I think it's technically still under the ownership of Action-Reaction Games. I haven't really talked to these guys in a little while, but last I heard they were trying to license it out. I haven't heard anything about that. I'm assuming it hasn't happened yet.</p><p>The technology we built was really solid. It is a full-on multiplayer video game backend. You can build any type of multiplayer game within the framework we built. It's very powerful.</p><p>To be honest, it was also very cumbersome. It can get a little bit too much and maybe we overdid it on the tech. That's really one of the biggest things - maybe we overdid it on the tech. That's where a lot of our money went, where it did not need to go. To the engineers trying to over-engineer stuff.</p><h2 id=\"what-were-some-of-the-biggest-mistakes-that-you-made\">What were some of the biggest mistakes that you made?</h2><p>There were moments of panic where I made quick decisions that I should've just took a step back, took a breath and thought about it more. My panic caused others to panic, which was a formula for disaster.</p><p>I didn't personally feel confident. I didn't have the coding experience. Our CTO was really scaling up the tech and as he was scaling it up, I was falling behind because I wasn't able to keep up.</p><p>I didn't have the knowledge. I probably still don't to be honest; it was very, very advanced. So I think that was another hurdle. I was trying to fill shoes that I couldn't really fill. I probably could've put myself in a better role within the company that would have been more productive, more successful.</p><p>I was the producer, so I had a good role, I was keeping busy. I was managing all the releases. I was making sure builds were stable. I was doing quality assurance as much as I could, even though that was a challenge on its own.</p><p>The quality assurance and the testing process that we had was not good. It was hard to get the team to test for some reason. We just never wanted to play the game.</p><p>I was always saying guys, we have to test this. We need to test this. And, you know, we would test out 2v2 or 1v1 and yeah, okay, it works functionally. The program works, but does the game work? The game is built around 3v3. We need to play this 3v3. Guys, this is releasing soon. We need to play this 3v3.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/4v4-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"4v4-1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>2v2 testing&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>We never spent time making sure the game was actually fun. Like, literally sit down with a room full of people and play this thing to death until we know what we need to do. We never did that. I still don't do that with my current projects. That's another problem that I'm still facing but I'm working on that.</p><p>The biggest mistake that we made was when we landed our initial investment. We took a million dollar valuation on our pre-seed round.</p><p>If you have a million-dollar valuation on your pre-seed round and in reality, you're only worth one hundred thousand dollars. You take that money that you've got at that million-dollar valuation in order to grow into a million-dollar valuation.</p><p>When you do that, you have your original investors thinking they bought a million-dollar company and then your next investors actually get a million-dollar company and then your original investors get screwed or you're screwing the next investors because they're getting a worse deal than your previous investors got.</p><p>It creates this dynamic of an impossible to raise funding round. If we had taken a real valuation from the beginning, we probably would've landed that second round. There was real value in the end but not when we took our initial valuation.</p><h2 id=\"if-you-could-start-all-over-again-what-would-you-do-differently\">If you could start all over again, what would you do differently?</h2><p>Focus on the programming fundamentals. I would spend more time understanding software design concepts and how to scale software because you're going to build software that you can't move at a certain point because you're just not building it properly.</p><p>Eventually you'll have thousands of lines of code that's just gridlocked because it's so crap. You literally have to scrap it. I've done that. I've done that multiple times and it sucks.</p><p>If I just had better fundamentals at the beginning, we might have had a whole year head start.</p><p>I use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID\">SOLID design principles</a> and other similar concepts now. I think that helps a lot. You don't have to keep rewriting stuff just to get one piece of functionality working. You also encountered way less bugs and way less problems along the way.</p><h2 id=\"after-your-two-week-break-what-was-a-turning-point-for-starting-something-new\">After your two-week break, what was a turning point for starting something new?</h2><p>I would think about it all the time. In the back of my head, while running Action Reaction Games, I always looked at these micro game companies, like <a href=\"https://www.voodoo.io/\">Voodoo</a> or <a href=\"https://popcore.com/\">POPCORE</a>. These are super huge companies that literally make the simplest games ever. &nbsp;They are always top charting.</p><p>Once I took a break and I thought, ok, I could maybe try and release a game. It slowly started happening. I had this vision of a whole framework to help reduce the cost of game development. One day I woke up and thought, it's time to start.</p><p>There was also an emotional hurdle. I almost felt guilty, as if I was cheating on Action React Games by doing my own thing, which is a weird feeling. It felt like divorce. It was crazy.</p><p>It started with just seeing how fast I can get a game out. I got a game out from day one in 20 days called emoji tap. That was pretty cool. Then I re-skinned it into the Halloween version about 14 days later. So I technically launched two games within the first two months, which felt great.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-10-at-20.27.26.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot-2020-05-10-at-20.27.26\" width=\"1876\" height=\"1182\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Emoji tap</figcaption></figure><p>I think I really learned the importance of goals, deadlines and scheduling from building Battle Blobs. I also learned a lot of my programming fundamentals building a bigger project. The pace of my learning has definitely slowed, but I'm really enjoying my work right now.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-keeping-you-busy-these-days\">What is keeping you busy these days?</h2><p>My new project is officially called 9 Cent Games. I'm really focused on building out the framework, so I can quickly and easily make new games. It handles in-app purchases, ads, products and pretty much everything that you could need for a minimum-viable-product. </p><p>From there, I plan on creating games and then having the games help grow the framework. When the framework grows, the games also grow by inheritance.</p><p>I want to make sure all games built using our framework have a solid foundation for success. I want to enable developers to build quickly while also reducing the cost of development. That's the idea.</p><p>It is very mobile-focused. Everything regarding iOS and Android deployment is completely handled. It's all cross-platform. This is probably already done but it's mainly a good exercise for me to build my skills as I'm trying to do this.</p><p>I just released my new game, Germs: Virus Smash! on Android. It's never coming to iOS because Apple said no. They don't want to release any virus games during the quarantine.</p><p>I'm pivoting it into Quirks. It's a subatomic particle game. It'll be the exact same game as Germs basically, but it'll have a different skin instead.</p><hr><p>If you want to follow Joey's journey further, you can find him on Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/9centgames/\">@9centgames</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joe_torbett/\">@joe_torbett</a>.

This felt very exciting. The hunt was on for his email address, which wasn't as easy to find as one might expect.</p><p>After a few targeted Google searches, I found an address I thought might work and began my draft. When given a task, I generally don't like to waste time, so instead of figuring out what to write, I filmed a video:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\" data-test-label=\"fitted\">\n        <div class=\"fluid-width-video-container\">\n          <div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\" class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\">\n            <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixwUxOudDQI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" name=\"fitvid0\"></iframe>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </figure><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8K0B270cgE\">#LockdownConf</a> was the following day, so I knew I'd have to be patient with my reply.

It felt silly not to put some effort into following through with this!</p><p>My persistence wasn't unnoticed and early one morning, I had a reply waiting in my inbox:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/Screenshot_2020-04-21_at_19.45.02.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot_2020-04-21_at_19.45.02\" width=\"2552\" height=\"846\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Almost exactly two years earlier, I had written a brief article recounting <a href=\"https://medium.com/@braedongough/my-first-two-weeks-in-free-code-camp-c99b990e4bdb\">my first two weeks in freeCodeCamp</a>. It was meant to help keep myself accountable for staying on track, however, it now serves as a timestamp for me to trace when I started my learning. The first line in the article was,</p><p>One of my favourite things to read was stories of how established developers started their journey coding.</p><p>The opportunity to share my own story on the same platform that got me started was an absolutely incredible feeling. It chokes me up every time I think about it.</p><p>Within ten minutes, I had submitted my application to become an author on the publication. Every free minute I had that day was spent writing out my story and at 22:12 that evening, I had sent my first draft off to be reviewed by the lovely editors of the blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/abbey-is-joining-the-freecodecamp-team-as-an-editor-4b2600167f8/\">Abbey</a> was quick to share her feedback, which I hastily implemented the following day. I was taken by complete surprise when later that afternoon, she had written me back, and my story had been published for almost twenty minutes!</p><h2 id=\"my-story-goes-live\">My Story Goes Live</h2><p>As someone who virtually never posts on social media, it was certainly fun to watch the analytics climb exponentially compared to my usual inactivity. </p><p>Additionally, as a new author on the freeCodeCamp publication, I was now granted access to view the google analytics of not just my post, but of the whole site. I love this type of stuff, so I wasted no time before poking around.</p><p>I struggled to find anything super interesting in google analytics, although, it was fun to track how many people were actively viewing my article, as well as how many page views it had received over time:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/Screenshot_2020-04-22_at_08.57.28.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot_2020-04-22_at_08.57.28\" width=\"1636\" height=\"1242\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Pages views from April 12 - 20, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>I received dozens of connection requests on Linkedin and a significant increase in profile viewers. Even with an upgrade to premium, I found limited data available aside from the graph available to everyone:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/Screenshot_2020-04-22_at_09.01.52.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot_2020-04-22_at_09.01.52\" width=\"1700\" height=\"712\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Linkedin profile views, January - April 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Twitter was probably the most fun. I didn't know they had an easily accessible <a href=\"https://analytics.twitter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analytics app</a> available to explore. It's hilarious to see the huge disconnect between how many tweets I've made in the last 28 days relative to the 14,000% growth in visits to my profile:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/Screenshot_2020-04-22_at_09.07.44.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screenshot_2020-04-22_at_09.07.44\" width=\"1902\" height=\"470\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Twitter account summary for April 2020</figcaption></figure><p>It's certainly fun to watch the numbers climb but at the end of the day, but these are nothing more than vanity metrics. The real impact of sharing my story is much harder to measure.</p><h2 id=\"what-i-really-learned\">What I Really Learned</h2><p>I was completely floored by the number of people that wrote me detailed and thoughtful private messages, thanking me for sharing. </p><p>I could have never anticipated that my silly story about my past life as a salesperson now acts as a source of motivation for those that are now in a nearly identical situation as I was 2 years prior. It makes me regret not writing every author who's story helped me stay just motivated enough not to give up.</p><p>I don't think it matters where you're at in your journey, whether that be a senior software architect at a massive global tech company or a student in the first module of a web development boot camp. I'm certain there are people out there that need your insight and experience to keep their spirits just high enough to not give up.</p><p>Initiatives like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/learninpublic\">#LearnInPublic</a> have such a huge following because the appetite for others' experiences is absolutely insatiable. It probably feels like one more blog post, tweet, or video won't make a difference, however, that couldn't be further from the truth.</p><p>There was a common theme I noticed between messages. Even though it can sometimes feel like there are an unlimited amount of resources and community platforms available, there is still huge demand for advice, mentorship, courses, and learning tools.</p><h2 id=\"how-you-can-help\">How you can help</h2><p>There are many ways you can offer direct help. Writing about your experience is probably the lowest barrier to entry. Making an account on Medium takes virtually no effort, and their large audience will certainly help with distribution.</p><p>Maybe writing isn't necessarily your thing. Creating short and concise videos can save others hours of frustration. I've enjoyed using <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/\">Loom</a> as an easy way of recording screencasts. They handle uploading, give you a platform to edit videos, and allow you to make the video interactive. It's also super easy to download your content from their dashboard if you'd prefer to host your videos on YouTube.</p><p>Making videos can be a bit intimidating and its possible you simply don't have the available gear to make that happen. There is definitely a severe lack of mentors available to the majority of people. Platforms like <a href=\"https://codingcoach.io/\">Coding Coach</a> certainly help fill the gap but it's incredibly surprising how few people even know this is an option!</p><p>If instead of 1:1, you'd prefer a 1:many setting, there are many organizations, such as <a href=\"https://www.hackyourfuture.net/\">Hack Your Future</a>, that are always searching for volunteer mentors to help teach classes for their free web development program. They've even open-sourced their <a href=\"https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum\">curriculum</a>! Maybe your calling is starting a free coding school in your own community.</p><p>The entire tech community is built around free online resources and open-sourced software for learning and development. The amount of people that give back to that same community is drastically underwhelming.</p><p>Please consider how you can start taking small steps to share your experience and knowledge, so others can benefit from the same way you have.</p><p>Don't be a stranger!

headed to Copenhagen from Toronto Pearson Airport. I was starting my two semester exchange at the Copenhagen Business school. </p><p>I can easily remember the date because it was my brother's birthday. He was forced to spend it at the airport with our family as they sent me off to Denmark, for what they thought would only be 8 months.</p><p>My only familiarity with Copenhagen was from watching the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYOCa7kusJg\">CPH Open on Thrasher Magazine's YouTube channel</a>. Luckily for me, I absolutely fell in love with the city and, after my first semester abroad, I made it my mission to stay here even longer. I was due to start an internship upon returning back to Canada and challenged myself to find one in Copenhagen instead.</p><h2 id=\"working-in-copenhagen\">Working in Copenhagen</h2><p>I didn't really have a plan, so I started looking for roles as a sales development representative (SDR). I had just learned about this entry-level role in one of my classes. Since all of my previous experience was in sales and customer service, I thought it would be a good fit.</p><p>I sent out my application to a young startup and within 4 hours, I was on the phone with my soon-to-be sales manager. That was my first taste of how quickly things can move in startup-land! About a month later, I had my first day. This was also the first time I had met professional developers.</p><p>I've always had a deep interest in technology, although the closest I'd been to software development at that point was in my Visual Basic class in high school! </p><p>Starting my new job was the first time I got to work directly alongside developers. It was thrilling to hear about their work. There were always so many buzz words and technologies they spoke about – React, Ember, Scala, Python, TypeScript, boilerplate-code, compliers, rendering. It was intimidating to think you had to know about so much to develop software.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/Famly-office-sales-2-1920x1200.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Sales floor picture\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>The sales floor I worked on</figcaption></figure><p>I spent the next year and a half continuing to progress in my sales career, eventually being promoted to account executive. I felt like I had greatly developed my communication, time-management, and presentational skills. </p><h2 id=\"discovering-freecodecamp\">Discovering freeCodeCamp</h2><p>Although I was successful in my current role as an account executive, I wasn't sure if a future in sales was exactly what I wanted. It was also limiting to my future job prospects if I wanted to continue to remain in Denmark – it's not easy find a good job selling in English in a country where the first language is Danish!</p><p>I found myself reading more, searching for a new hobby or challenge. That's when I found the freeCodeCamp blog (it was still on Medium at that time). It actually took me a few days before I realized freeCodeCamp wasn't just a blog, it was an entire platform available to learn how to code online, for free! As if the name didn't speak for itself...</p><p>It only took completing a few HTML challenges before I was absolutely hooked. It was then that I decided I would spend all my free time working through the freeCodeCamp curriculum, with the goal of one day in the long-distant future maybe becoming a developer. I loved the idea of being able to speak to my colleagues about React, however far-away that felt.</p><h2 id=\"struggling-with-the-basics\">Struggling with the Basics</h2><p>I was feeling fairly confident in how quickly I was learning HTML and CSS until I actually attempted to complete one of the projects. Create a simple portfolio? This should be easy! </p><p>But it was overwhelming how lost I suddenly felt in an editor outside of freeCodeCamp. Attempting to start a project from scratch seemed impossible and it was frightening how quickly it felt like I forgot everything. Becoming a real developer suddenly felt like an impossibility.</p><p>Finally asking for help was the best thing I did for myself. After stewing in my frustration for far too long, I reached out to a colleague who patiently guided me through using VS Code, structuring my HTML document, and linking it to a CSS file. After finally cobbling together a portfolio, I checked the box as done, even though I felt my work was terrible compared to others attempting this same challenge.</p><p>I eventually made my way into the JavaScript curriculum, which I had been impatiently waiting to start after about a month and half of struggling through HTML and CSS. </p><h2 id=\"learning-javascript\">Learning JavaScript</h2><p>It started out easy enough, although it wasn't before long that I found myself lost and frustrated again. After completing all of the JavaScript modules, I felt I was lacking the confidence and tenacity to attempt the more difficult JavaScript projects. Instead, I took the easy way out and started through the Codecademy JavaScript curriculum.</p><p>It was certainly helpful in solidifying the basics for me – after all, repetition is key. However, the biggest mistake I made in my learning journey was not going back to attempt those challenges. </p><p>After working through all of the Codecademy modules, I started yet another JavaScript course, this time purchasing \"The JavaScript Bootcamp\" through Udemy. As this was my third time working through the fundamentals, I left that course with more stable footing and more confidence in my ability to work with JavaScript. </p><h2 id=\"starting-at-pleo\">Starting at Pleo</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/P1111151_-1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"group photo of my colleagues\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1074\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Pleo Team Camp, Dec 2019</figcaption></figure><p>From there, I jumped straight into another course, this time on Node directly followed up with a course on React.</p><p>Somewhere between the Node and React courses, I had started a new job as an account manager at what I still deem to be <a href=\"https://www.pleo.io\">Denmark's coolest startup</a>. It was and is incredibly exciting to be a part of a company growing so fast. It was even more exciting to meet so many new and talented developers to learn from.</p><p>About three months into my new job, my manager and I were discussing how my role could develop in the future. I was honest with her and said I wasn't interested in any further responsibility. I wanted to spend any and all excess capacity teaching myself to code, with the hopes of one day becoming a developer. </p><p>This is not something you want to hear from a relatively new sales rep on your team. But to my surprise, she was incredibly supportive and made a commitment to help me any way she could, as long as I hit my targets.</p><h2 id=\"attempting-the-coding-challenge\">Attempting the Coding Challenge</h2><p>After speaking with one of our engineering directors, it was clear that for us to continue a conversation around what a transition from sales to product would look like, I would need to complete our frontend hiring challenge, like an outside candidate would.</p><p>The thought of attempting this was both incredibly intimidating and motivating. This is when I started staying late in the office every night. I didn't want to waste time biking home, so the second the clock hit 17:00, I would scurry to find some dinner, returning to my desk as soon as possible, to start my day pretending to be a developer.</p><p>I had finally finished my React course just before the Christmas holiday and was working on a few side-projects, although I never really followed through with any of them. I knew I needed to start applying my knowledge but found it difficult to complete a project without a real end goal. </p><p>With some extra time on my hands over the holiday period, I began to look through the frontend challenge again. I still felt far from capable to produce a worthy submission, however, I felt it gave me some sort of end goal to work towards so I could actually finish something.</p><p>Luckily for me, our frontend challenge was very similar to the final project of the React course, so I could reuse much of the boilerplate and components for my submission. I definitely felt like I was cheating. </p><p>But I sent through <a href=\"https://github.com/braedongough/pleo-frontend-challenge\">my project</a> anyway and eagerly await feedback. Having my code reviewed by two of our senior engineers was incredibly scary and I was prepared for some harsh feedback.</p><p>After a couple weeks, my grade was in, and my submission wasn't a total failure! I had received some really great, actionable points of criticism. One of my colleagues even spent an hour with me after work, talking me through each line of feedback. Our code review session went so well, we decided to meet again, week after week, until well after I transitioned into becoming a developer. </p><h2 id=\"my-first-pr\">My First PR</h2><p>My sales manager and the director of engineering continued to check in on my progress throughout the coming months. In April, the opportunity was presented that I could possibly work on the side with our internal tools team. There were many small, non-urgent tickets that needed attention in our back-office system. </p><p>I was excited – it would be a great way for me to get some real experience in working with the product team and it was made very clear this wasn't to interfere with my work in sales. That thought of working with real, production code was INSANE!</p><p>After a bit of coordination, an introduction to the team, and an invite to our company Github org, I was given my first ticket to work on. </p><p>I was to add an input to make a field editable for our compliance team. It was immediately clear I had no idea how to do this. Sure, I've added an input before and I knew vaguely how forms worked in React but this code felt like nothing I'd seen in any of my tutorials.</p><p>I was suddenly left with an ocean of questions. How does TypeScript work? What is a branch? How do I make a PR? What do all of these libraries do? How does my code even get built and sent to our users? What happens if I break something important? </p><p>It took me a couple days to get my bearings, but after much patience and help from the engineering lead, I managed to get two approvals and ship code to production. That was a huge milestone in my journey.</p><h2 id=\"making-the-switch\">Making the Switch</h2><p>Over the next five months, I continued my routine of staying in the office late, working 09:00-17:00 in sales and 17:00 until whenever pretending to be a developer working with what I considered to be real code. </p><p>As you could expect, my desire to continue in sales dwindled every day and I started pressing to see if we could agree on a date for me to officially switch. </p><p>It certainly didn't go smoothly. No one had experience in what it means to move someone from sales to our product team. First and foremost, I had to be on target. I think that's true with most sales organisations – everything always comes back to making your quota.</p><p>After much back and forth, an agreement was made that I could officially make the switch August 1st, contingent that I remain on target. This was the light at the end of the tunnel for me. It was absolutely baffling to think I would soon be presented with an employment contract for my new role as a software engineer. The weeks leading up flew by. By 17:00, Wednesday, July 31, I was no longer an account manager.</p><p>There was definitely a transition period in getting used to my new role. It felt like being a stock broker working on the trading room floor to suddenly becoming a librarian. </p><p>Noise aside, there hasn't been a single day where I haven't been excited about coming into work. I've continued working in our internal tools team, building out our compliance and customer support back-office.</p><h2 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h2><p>The experience I gained in sales is incredibly advantageous in my work today. Strong communication, time-management, and presentational skills have been invaluable as a dev. But I have found these to be lacking in most dev communities I've observed.</p><p>I realize I'm incredibly lucky to have been presented an opportunity to work with production code so early on. <em> </em>It was without a doubt a huge leap forward in my learning and massively helped in expediting my understanding of the realities of working as a dev that is impossible to gain from online tutorials<em>. </em></p><p>Having a mentor to work with hugely accelerated my learning and was extremely helpful in keeping me accountable for always having a project on the go, so we always had something to work with. Without all of the support around me, I think I would still be spending all of my nights and weekends working through tutorials or building <a href=\"https://github.com/braedongough/random-pokemon-generator\">random Pokemon generators</a>. </p><p>I made a commitment early on to spend all of my free time continuing with my development. I think it's very easy to underestimate how large of a time commitment this journey is. Access to a mentor is a huge help, although even someone with enough knowledge to occasionally answer questions can save you hours of frustration. Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p><p>Looking retrospectively, I wish I would have spent more time building small projects and applying the things I learned. I frequently started projects but never followed through because I felt like I couldn't code something the correct way. </p><p>Spending time struggling through something has been way more helpful for my learning. There is certainly safety to staying on the rails of an interactive coding course but it can put a ceiling on your ability to apply your knowledge in the real world. I definitely fell into that trap.</p><p>It took me a while before a realized no one knows what the right way is, it's all made up. As a novice developer, there is value in a fresh perspective.</p><p>If there was one piece of advice I wish I had earlier on, it would have been to make a greater attempt to apply my knowledge as I learned. There is no such thing as real code or the correct way to do things, especially when you're learning. Any chance you have to apply your learnings along the way is valuable. </p><p>You're not a developer once someone pays you to be a developer, you're a developer the second you start coding.</p><p>Don't be a stranger!
