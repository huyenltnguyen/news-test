It was a typical slum which you see in movies – there were good people and a lot of bad people, too. I was lucky not to hang out with those bad people for long. </p><p>I was more of a lazy person, and cricket was my first love. I performed very poorly on my 10th exams. I was expecting to get better grades, but they were all below my expectations. </p><p>I was not sure what I was going to do next, so I thought I would try to get admitted in science but my marks weren't good enough.</p><h1 id=\"getting-into-computer-science\">Getting Into Computer Science </h1><p>I would say it was my luck or destiny. One of my dad's friends informed us about some Diploma courses. I applied for it and luckily I got in. </p><p>I had to choose from multiple courses, and I chose computer science without thinking twice. But it was not going to be easy.</p><h1 id=\"how-i-struggled-with-language\">How I struggled with language</h1><p>English is not my native language. I studied in a school where Hindi was my first language and I had accent issues as well (coming from the north, we have a different accent). I remember crying in a class because I couldn't understand a thing, and I was scared to fail again like I failed my expectations in 10th Standard.</p><p>I did really bad in our internal exams, but giving up was not an option this time. I never told my parents that I was struggling with my studies. I pulled myself back, started studying hard, stopped playing cricket, and isolated myself from friends. </p><p>The only thing I wanted to achieve was somehow not to fail in the first year of the 3-year program. In the upcoming exams, I did ok and got around 50% in the first year.</p><p>I was not happy, but that was the best I could do.</p><p>When I moved into the second year I was a better version of myself. I was more confident and scored better on my exams. And by my final year, I scored more than 60%.</p><p>I learned that <strong>if you decide to achieve something, you can and will do it</strong>. Never give up, because you can always learn if you are serious about it. For example, I remember when one of my classmates made fun of my accent – I took it as a challenge and improved it.</p><h1 id=\"dealing-with-a-setback\">Dealing with a Setback</h1><p>Once I passed my final exams, I was more interested in studying to get a CS degree. That was another 4-year program (3 years for me as I had gotten the 3-year diploma). </p><p>I intended to continue my studies, but when I was in my second year, my dad lost his job. I was not aware of it for a long time, then one day my dad gave bad news to me. He asked me to start looking for a job as he could not afford to pay the fee for my CS degree which was around 42k (550 USD) per year.</p><p>I was crying the entire night and couldn't sleep. The next day my mom, who noticed me crying, spoke to my dad – she said \"Do whatever you want to do, but my son is going to continue his studies.\"</p><p>My dad agreed, and with the help of my uncle (my dad's big brother) I was able to continue.</p><h1 id=\"getting-into-a-cs-degree-program\">Getting into a CS Degree Program</h1><p>I scored well enough on my exams to get into the CS degree program. I was admitted into the 2nd year and to one of the colleges which had just opened in 2004. So it wasn't a Tier-1 college, but it was from Mumbai University and I was happy to get in. </p><p>The same year we had heavy floods in Mumbai so the entire admission process was postponed. Within 2 months we had our exams, and I was lucky I didn't fail any subjects.</p><p>When I went into my 3rd year, I started borrowing books from the library to study because I had no money to buy those books. A few of my professors used to borrow them for me, so I could use them to study during exams and return them afterward.</p><p>By the time I was ready to complete my 3rd year, my family's finances had gotten worse. I thought of dropping out this time, but one of my friends with whom I shared this news said: 'You don't worry about it, I will do something'. </p><p>I almost cried. But during vacation, my dad told me that he managed to save up the money for the final year.</p><p>I was happy and I did well in my final year. In my final exam, I scored close to 70%. I thought that this bad phase was gone since I finally had a degree. But there was something happening that I didn't know about.</p><h1 id=\"the-recession-of-2008\">The Recession of 2008</h1><p>The Great Recession happened, and not many companies were hiring that year. I was not sure of what I wanted to do next.</p><p>My friends said I was good at coding, so I should get into it. I realized I really enjoyed coding, and I fell in love with C#. </p><p>I waited for three or four months before I could get my first job. At that job, I could study new things and get paid too – my salary was 5k INR, or around $68 USD per month. </p><p>After 8 months I decided to leave that job and was jobless for a month. I got some support work for the next 4 months, which required some knowledge of SQL queries, so I brushed up on that knowledge.</p><p>Finally, in January 2010, I got a job where I could write some code. It was a Windows application using C#. I gave my best, but the salary was still very low.</p><p>I was getting paid 12k ($163 USD) per month, and there was not enough work. I spoke to my manager about this and he told me to take this as an opportunity to learn something new.</p><p>I started reading more C# and another colleague of mine who was a DBA helped me with SQL (creating Stored Procedures, functions, and writing queries). Within 10 months I got an offer with a 100% raise. A giant step! I worked on this new job for another 8 months.</p><h1 id=\"joining-the-startup\">Joining the Startup</h1><p>I joined a startup in August 2011, and went on to work there for the next 5 years. The pay was good, and I got more than a 50% raise when I joined. And I finally had insurance provided by the company and PF too. </p><p>I gave my best when I started, and I used to deliver things really fast because I wanted more work. Within a few months, I had built up a good relationship with the team and everyone including my CEO appreciated my work.</p><p>I realized that <strong>not everyone gets a kick start</strong> to their career, but don't give up – keep giving it your best wherever you work, and one day you will get your dream job.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-never-a-smooth-ride\">It's never a smooth ride</h2><p>I thought now, everything will be fine – I have a more settled job, and a good salary, but you never know what can go wrong.</p><p>My wife was pregnant, and suddenly around the 6th month she had some complications. The doctor told us we had to do urgent surgery and said that they weren't sure if they could save the baby. </p><p>He asked us if we could move the baby to one of the hospitals which was known to handle cases like these. There was a chance she could survive, but it would cost us more than my entire year's salary.</p><p>And I said that I would do anything to save her.</p><p>I hardly had any savings as I was supporting my family and taking care of all our daily expenses.</p><p>The entire hospital bill including my wife's surgery was 8L ($11K USD) and insurance covered only 5%. I took some personal loans from the bank and my friends helped me with some money. </p><p>Also, I spoke to my manager to see if I could get an extra raise that year, which was around 40% more than I was getting. To my surprise, my manager and my CEO agreed and I got the raise.</p><p>I used to go to the hospital daily to see my daughter, then go to work. This was my schedule for three months. She was born with a weight of 845 g and was around 1.5 kg once she came home. </p><p>I continued working hard and paid all my friends back, but the personal loan was where I was paying most of my salary. My wife sold her all jewelry so we could finishing paying it back and repay some of my friends, too.</p><p>I was finally able to buy her a ring and some more gold jewelry last month – I don't have to tell you how happy she was.</p><p><strong>Life is not easy for anyone</strong>. You need to stand up to any challenge, you will have tough times, but if you face it head on it will make you stronger.</p><h1 id=\"in-search-of-a-better-life\">In search of a better life</h1><p>I had started focusing more on my career so I could make more money and pay off my loans. But I missed spending time with my daughter and wife. </p><p>I had left my parent's house to start my own family, with no savings of my own. One of my friends rented me a house, where I lived for a year and we had no bed to sleep in. We built our home from nothing. </p><p>I lived there for a year and bought some mattresses to sleep on eventually and purchased a laptop to practice programming (yes – I had no laptop of my own until 2015).</p><p><strong>Not everyone knows you struggle sometimes – even your family</strong>.<strong> </strong>Don't give up, though. Not everyone is going to support you when you are at low points of your life. But if you're lucky, you'll have good friends who support you and help you out when others can't or won't. </p><h1 id=\"what-kept-me-strong\">What kept me strong</h1><p>Between 2012-2015 there were many times when I really wanted to give up. But I also wanted to fight for my daughter and wife and give them a better life, and I wanted to be my best at my job.</p><p>If you are reading this, please spend time with family. You don't get paid to work more than 8 hours, anything above that is the free work for your employer.</p><p>After 2015 I was asked to work more than 8 hours only once and my answer was no because that's how it starts. Work for yourself instead, learn something new, practice, and build something. It will help you in the future.</p><h1 id=\"moving-to-pune\">Moving to Pune</h1><p>Around 2016 I left the startup because my manager was pretty toxic. When I left, all my co-workers clapped for me, it was a very emotional moment.</p><p>I moved to Pune to work with one of the MNC. I started giving more time to my family, worked no more than 8 hours a day, and I didn't work on weekends. During this time, I realized I wanted to write blogs, so I even wrote few blogs on .Net, AngularJS, and Angular.</p><p>I started taking training for Angular and made some money. I purchased a bed, got my daughter admitted into a good school, and also paid off some loans. 2017 was a good year for me and my family.</p><p>The extra income was really helping us. I remember the old mattress was really in bad condition and it started impacting our health. My wife had a very bad backache because of it, and the extra money helped me invest in a good high-quality mattress.</p><p><strong>Never get stuck in your comfort zone</strong>. If work is not challenging enough or you are not enjoying it, leave that job if you're able.</p><p>Also,<strong> family is important</strong>. One of the reasons we moved to new city was that I was missing all my family time. I was investing more time at work rather than in family, and travel was making it worse.</p><h1 id=\"another-bad-phase\">Another Bad Phase</h1><p>2018 started off a little rough. I spent four months recording a course for one person and he didn't pay me. I had some conflict with the organization I used to conduct training with, so I left them.</p><p>I was earning money, but my learning had stopped and I was not doing anything for the community. I was earning money because of OSS. </p><p>But then my daughter was diagnosed with TB. I was scared and demotivated again, and I had joined Deutsche bank at the end of 2017. So work was good, there wasn't much pressure, and pay was also good.</p><p>I didn't have time in 2018 to do much for the community, but I performed well in my project where I was working full-time on Angular.</p><h1 id=\"a-resurrection-and-my-journey-to-gde\">A Resurrection and My Journey to GDE</h1><p>After a bad 2018, I had something different in mind for 2019. I really wanted to contribute to the community, but I didn't know how to do it.</p><p>I decided to attend an Angular conference (my first conference ever) where I met Vikram from the Angular Team and asked him for some tips.</p><p>After coming home from the conference, I wanted to start contributing, and Angular was the framework I was in love with. </p><p>But couldn't find any issues which I could work on, so I decided to go to NgRx. I found one issue and raised my first PR on 28th Feb, and started contributing more. </p><p>Around mid-March I found an Issue in the Angular repo I could take on, and started working on it and finally raised my first <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/29376\">PR</a> there.</p><p>In March I learned about something called the GDE Program for Angular. I decided to go ahead and check it out, and learned you get invited based on your contributions. It's true – before that, I was not aware of the GDE program. </p><p>I figured out that I was too far away from the GDE and anyways it wasn't my motivation to start contributing.</p><p><strong>It doesn't matter when you start contributing to open source</strong>.<strong> </strong>I get this question a lot, but I had never worked on OSS my whole life. My advice is that it's never too late to start. I started contributing to OSS after turning 32, working for 1o years in tech jobs, and it was the best decision I ever made. </p><h1 id=\"writing-for-indepth-dev\">Writing for inDepth.dev</h1><p>I had stopped writing for a long time. I remember while working on one PR for NgRx where the NgRx team motivated me to write an article and even helped me with the review. </p><p>The article was published and I was excited, as I loved inDepth.dev for its quality content. I never thought that one day I would write on that platform.</p><h1 id=\"my-first-open-source-project\">My first open source project</h1><p>Around June 2019 I started to work on a personal project. I learned about Angular Builders, and Minko gave a nice example on how to deploy your app on GitHub pages. I was inspired by it, so I decided to create one for Netlify for myself and published it on NPM.</p><p>It became popular and now is used by more than 200+ projects on GitHub. And it also became part of the Angular Docs.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/ngx-builders/netlify-builder\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">ngx-builders/netlify-builder</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Deploy your Angular app to netlify from CLI.

So I decided to send him an email. Within a week I was confirmed as a speaker.</p><p>It was my first talk in the front of 300 developers. I was scared, but I learned something: <strong>No one is going to be amazing when they give their first talk</strong>. I watched the recording and I improved myself, and I read blogs on how to improve as speaker.</p><h1 id=\"getting-invited-to-the-google-developer-expert-program\">Getting Invited to the Google Developer Expert Program</h1><p>In August, I got a message on LinkedIn from Siddhant Agarwal from Google asking if I would be interested in applying for the Google Developer Expert program. In September 2019 my application was accepted and my interview was scheduled.</p><p>And on November 13th, which is my birthday, I was announced as a GDE.</p><p>A few months ago, I thought I could never become one – but sometimes, when you work hard enough, you don't need to ask for anything.</p><p><strong>Again, never give up</strong>.<strong> </strong>I never thought I would be a GDE one day. I only wanted to give my best to the community. Don't expect anything return, just keep giving your best and you will get more back than you could ever imagine.</p><h1 id=\"support-from-my-new-employer\">Support from my New Employer</h1><p>Unfortunately, in late 2019, I had to leave my job at Deutsche Bank. It wasn't a pleasant experience, but I got through it.</p><p>My new employer supported me in this situation, and the HR department always reassured me that they had my back and that I would be joining the team. </p><p><strong>Not all organizations are bad </strong>– many do care about their employees. I would love to see a day where all organizations care about OSS and encourage more employees to contribute to the community.</p><h1 id=\"post-feb-2020\">Post-Feb 2020</h1><p>Life after Feb 2020 has been good so far. I have been able to speak at conferences without worrying about my employer, as they don't have any issues with it. And I started contributing to OSS again, and started a Talk Show called \"Tech Talks with Santosh\" which you can check out here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/TechTalksWithSantosh\">https://www.youtube.com/TechTalksWithSantosh</a></p><h2 id=\"becoming-india-s-first-github-star\">Becoming India's First GitHub Star</h2><p>In March 2020, GitHub came up with the <a href=\"https://stars.github.com/\">GitHub Star program</a>. This is different from other programs, as you cannot nominate yourself – instead, you need to be nominated by other developers in the community. </p><p>I posted about this program, and asked my fellow developers to nominate someone who deserved to be there. I was not expecting many developers to nominate me! But then I got the email to submit my profile. </p><p>I was shocked and scared, but I submitted my profile. Then in November I was announced as a GitHub Star. I was the first one from India.</p><p>More than anything I was happy to see the the Indian flag on the <a href=\"https://stars.github.com/profiles/santoshyadavdev/\">GitHub Star profile.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/05/image-86.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image-86\" width=\"196\" height=\"260\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>GitHub Star Logo</figcaption></figure><h1 id=\"what-s-next\">What's Next</h1><p>Like all developers out there, I do have a dream. Below are a few things I want to achieve:</p><ul><li>Contribute more towards Open Source.</li><li>Inspire more developers to contribute to Open Source.</li><li>Work hard on my Show \"Tech Talks with Santosh\" to share my knowledge with the community.</li><li>Work towards my dream job as a Developer Advocate, because that's what I love to do – helping developers succeed.</li></ul><h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>This isn't really a conclusion, as my story is still in progress. I believe everyone has a story worth telling, and this is my story so far.</p><p>To end, here are a few important question which I ask myself:</p><blockquote>Is my struggle over?<br>I don't know.<br>Will everything will be alright?<br>I don't know.<br>Am I going to stop fighting?<br>To quit is not an option.</blockquote><p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n\n                        </section>\n                        \n                            <div class=\"sidebar\">\n                                \n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"ad-wrapper\" data-test-label=\"ad-wrapper\">\n    \n    <div class=\"ad-text\" data-test-label=\"ad-text\">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\n    <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block;

   \n<p>Hey everyone, my name is Santosh. In this article, I will tell you how I ramped up my career and ended up increasing my salary as a developer. </p><p>I'll share what I learned from each job along the way, how you can stand out, tips for negotiating salary, and how I got to where I am today.</p><p>Here's a little bit more about me: I am from India, and I am an Angular GDE, India's First GitHub Star, and Auth0 Ambassador. I also live stream on Twitch and YouTube. You can <a href=\"https://www.santoshyadav.dev/\">find more about me here</a>.</p><h1 id=\"how-it-all-started\">How It All Started</h1><p>I started my developer journey in 2008. I couldn't get a job after college – 2008 was the worst year for the entire tech industry, as many already know.</p><p>When I was in college doing my CS degree, my friends used to tell me that'd I'd be able to quickly get a job making 300000 INR ($4000) per year. But by the final semester, it became clear that it wasn't happening.</p><p>After finishing college, my friend and I went around to every job consultancy to share our resumes. But we couldn't get any bites. We updated our resumes on every job platform available, but no one was hiring freshers.</p><h2 id=\"how-i-got-my-first-developer-job\">How I Got My First Developer Job</h2><p>Finally, one of my father's friends who ran a consultancy got me an interview scheduled. I was looking for a job as a developer in C#, and I joined the company the next day after the interview. It was 18th October 2008.</p><p>The organization was small, but the CEO had a big vision with the product he was building. I don't want to call it a Startup, because it was an HR consulting firm, which was his main business. My salary was 60000 INR ($800) per year.</p><p>I had a lot of free time, and I took the opportunity to use that time to learn more. Still, I was not that serious and enjoyed my free time. I learned a little bit from a senior developer on my team, though. I decided to quit after ten months, as I realized it wasn't good for my career.</p><h2 id=\"from-jobless-to-small-time-contracts\">From Jobless to Small Time Contracts</h2><p>After I decided to quit that first job, I went home for one month. With my friend's reference, I got a contract position for a few months.</p><p>The pay was a little bit more, this time 120000 INR ($1600) per year, which was double what I was making before. But the work was more operations-focused and working with Oracle DB sometimes.</p><p>My first love was C#, but my family's finances were terrible, so I had no option but to take that job. By the end of 2009, it was clear – I wouldn't have this contract next year. So again, I tried hard and got a job.</p><h2 id=\"my-first-real-programming-job\">My First Real Programming Job</h2><p>I got my first real programming job in January 2010. I started working with Capita India, but I joined as a contractor on another company's payroll. It was like a contract position, but more stable than the last job.</p><p>My salary was 144000 INR ($1900), money was low, but of course, I was getting an opportunity to learn as well. My manager was terrific, and my co-worker was the Database Admin. Yes, you guessed it right – I was the only developer on the team.</p><p>For the first three months, I had a lot of work to do. I was working on a Windows App for the finance team. But soon work stopped coming. I spoke to my manager, and he said I should use that time to learn more.</p><p>After a few months, I became part of a larger team after some organization-level changes. I started getting some work on ASP.NET, but I decided to move on in November 2010.</p><p>Something I learned from this job: <strong>Use your spare time well</strong>. You won't always have enough work to do to keep you busy all the time. Use your spare time to read blogs, watch some courses, read, and create some proof of concepts with whatever you've learned.</p><p>The time I invested in learning paid off. I got an offer with a 100% raise. My manager provided a lot of motivation which is why I got that raise. As I had no computer at home, I read a lot, which was the best chance to improve myself.</p><h2 id=\"working-for-a-bank-and-on-a-big-team\">Working for a Bank and on a Big Team</h2><p>Like my previous job, my next role was also on the payroll of another company. I was working for ICICI as a contractor, the same as my last Job at Capita.</p><p>But for the first time, I was working on a team of more than 60 people, and my salary was 288000 INR ($3900). I felt like I was finally making good money as a dev, but I finished the project I was working on in ten months, and the work stopped coming in again.</p><p>At this job, I learned more about working on a team and saw how bad managers could make people quit. By the time I left, there were fewer than ten people on the team. This place became toxic over the months, and devs were terrified to share anything with the manager, and so that manager had trust issues with all developers. </p><p>I also learned that you<strong> shouldn't stay and work in a toxic environment.</strong> I have seen many developers working in toxic work environments. A toxic work culture is terrible for everyone, and it can turn your co-workers against you. It also makes you less productive, more insecure about your job, and it can make you burn out. Quit as soon as possible – you deserve better.</p><p>Fortunately, I invested time in learning some new packages introduced in .NET, and I found that there were a lot of job opportunities for that tech here. I interviewed at a startup and showcased tech I never used at work. And it paid off – I ended up getting the job with a more than 70% raise.</p><p>Here are some tips for negotiating your salary:</p><h3 id=\"always-know-your-worth\">Always Know Your Worth</h3><p>In the tech industry, you will find different devs doing the same job but not getting paid equally. Some organizations take advantage of you and pay you less. Always study the market if you are looking for a job. Ask for the salary range if possible.</p><h3 id=\"never-negotiate-salary-based-on-your-last-pay\">Never Negotiate Salary Based on Your Last Pay</h3><p>Always ask your recruiter for a salary range. If you hear it will be 30% above your last salary, you might skip them. Always keep the figure you want in your mind, and negotiate based on that. I have even received a 100% raise from my last salary.</p><h3 id=\"know-the-job-description\">Know the Job Description </h3><p>Before joining any organization, know about the job description; money should not be your only focus. I declined a job offer with more salary once because the job was more of support, and I was about to get a work opportunity at the startup.</p><h2 id=\"joining-the-startup\">Joining the Startup</h2><p>At this point, I started to push myself more, as I wanted to make sure I could give my family a better life.</p><p>I joined a startup in 2012 with a salary offer of 450000 INR ($6000), which was a good raise from my last salary. It was also my first job where I worked for more than a year – I stayed for almost five.</p><p>I had been promoted to Team Lead by the time I left in 2016, and my salary was 1200000 INR ($16500). But I decided to go as I was not writing much code, my manager was very toxic, and I could not give much time to my family.</p><p>At that startup, though, I got to work with some fantastic managers and developers. We made an incredible team, and I am still proud of it. I think it was one of the best achievements of my career. I learned a lot about people management, which still helps me a lot.</p><p>Also, the growth was tremendous. I was able to get a raise of more than 30% every year until 2015.</p><p>Here are some things I learned from working at the startup:</p><h3 id=\"don-t-fall-in-love-with-your-organization\">Don't Fall in Love with Your Organization</h3><p>Even if you are the best employee at work, you are replaceable. I had worked extra hours for the startup, even though no one asked me to do it. </p><p>Because I loved the organization, I learned the hard way not to make that mistake again. Family time is more critical than an organization where you are just another employee.</p><h3 id=\"keep-your-skills-up-to-date\">Keep Your Skills Up to Date</h3><p>Keep learning! Sometimes we get stuck into the same tech stack over the years. Then when you go back into the job market, it has already moved on, and there is a new stack everyone's using. </p><p>A lot of organizations have a Pluralsight or other learning platform subscription, so use that if you can. If your company doesn't have one, there are <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/\">plenty of free learning resources</a> out there you can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ\">use instead or in addition</a>.</p><p>Once I decided to leave, I failed many interviews. But it was an eye-opening experience. I had learned everything I needed to work at my old job&nbsp;– but was I updated with what tech stack was currently in demand? No.</p><h2 id=\"moving-to-pune-for-a-better-life\">Moving to Pune for a Better Life</h2><p>In 2016 I decided to Join Synechron and moved to Pune. I joined as an individual contributor and started working on .NET with Angular.js.</p><p>My salary increased a little, but the cost of living was much cheaper than in Mumbai. My salary was little bit more than last pay, and I started making some extra income in 2017 by conducting online Angular Training. That was a great help as my finances were terrible.</p><p>It was the first time since 2011 that I had worked 40 hours a week, which meant that I had more time for me. I started learning Angular and teaching it as well. </p><p>The team was great, and the client gave me access to Pluralsight, which helped me learn Angular, a new Front-end framework. I completed all the courses by Deborah Kurata to learn more. I got some contracts to teach Angular and led me to get my next job at the Bank.</p><p>By the last quarter of 2017, we realized that the client we were working with was not going to give us any more work, and we needed to be prepared to move to another project.</p><h2 id=\"working-for-another-bank\">Working for Another Bank</h2><p>In Oct 2017, I joined a Bank with a good increase in salary. It was now around 40% more than last pay, thanks in part to my experience teaching Angular which impressed my hiring manager. I was also getting extra money from my training.</p><p>I got the chance to take complete control of the framework built on top of Angular. I talked to different teams about the feature they needed and helped them implement those features.</p><p>And more than that, I still had enough time to improve myself. I read more about Angular, and made the framework better.</p><p>I even received a performance bonus of 100000 INR ($1300) in 2018.</p><p>I was able to apply learnings from my previous jobs and I <strong>learned to say no</strong>. The most crucial skill you need as a developer is to be able to say no when you need to.</p><p>There will be times when your manager needs you to work extra hours – say no. One thing I learned is that very few things are critical and they can all usually be done the next day. Especially if it's a new feature and some not crucial bug fix.</p><h2 id=\"starting-open-source-contribution\">Starting Open Source Contribution</h2><p>By 2019 I decided to get more involved in the Angular community. I decided to start making Open Source contributions and began working with the NgRx and Angular projects.</p><p>I started writing blogs, giving talks, and even created some of my own open source projects. 2019 was more focused on the community, and I started improving my skills in Angular too by learning in public. This was all possible thanks to support from my manager.</p><p>I gained a lot working here. The critical thing I learned was how to stand out, which is still helping me to get new work.</p><p>And here are some more tips to help you improve:</p><h3 id=\"learn-in-public\">Learn in Public</h3><p>At work, as a developer, we get to face so many issues, but often we just solve the problems and move on. You know you can share that experience with other developers. Start writing blogs, and create content. You will learn more by sharing your knowledge.</p><h3 id=\"contribute-to-open-source\">Contribute to Open Source</h3><p>I have learned more by contributing to Open Source than from almost anything else. It lets me promote myself, too. It might even help you get your next job. I got better opportunities because of my Open Source Contributions and the connections I made in those communities.</p><h2 id=\"starting-my-remote-job\">Starting My Remote Job</h2><p>By the end of 2019, I had the opportunity to speak at some conferences, which the bank wouldn't let me do. So I decided to quit, and one of my friends <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bitcollage\">Serkan</a> helped me land a new job because of all the contributions I was making to the Open Source community.</p><p>I received around 50% raise from the last salary. I was going to start working remotely, which meant more time for family and community efforts. At this job, I got to work on a product and used Nx DevTools for the first time. I also learned how I could improve the performance of the App.</p><p>In 7 months, I implemented SSR and optimized bundle size. I converted the app to smaller libraries, so it was easier to add more apps in the future. I also shared these learnings with the community.</p><h2 id=\"going-solo\">Going Solo</h2><p>I decided to quit my full-time job in Oct 2019 and move into consulting. I had a good connection on Twitter, and everything started with a tweet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ok just want to check, anyone hiring a remote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angular?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@angular</a> developer, I am looking for a full-time opportunity.  I know not the best time to look for a job.</p>— Santosh Yadav (@SantoshYadavDev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SantoshYadavDev/status/1284009382267637761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 17, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>Many developers responded with some solid leads. Finally, I got my first client and started working in October 2020. I got my next client in November 2020, all thanks to my community contributions.</p><p>Around the same time, I became India's First GitHub Star. Both are good-paying clients, and I make much better salary now. I was able to pay off the loans I took out in 2012 to pay medical bills for my daughter and wife.</p><p>So far, the consulting gig is fantastic. I get to help many developers and I improve my knowledge while improving the platform.</p><p>It also helps me give time to the community and support Open Source developers by donating some money towards OSS.</p><h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>Working for the community did wonders for my career. It took me 12 years to move from $1,000 to a more stable salary, but the journey so far has been worth it. I saw days when I had to think how we would survive, and I wondered how I would give a better life to my daughter and my family.</p><p>The experience at every job has been different. I suggest that you start learning in public. It always helped me give my best and it built up my confidence so that I knew I could sell my skills.</p><p>And don't forget that salary negotiation is an important skill.
